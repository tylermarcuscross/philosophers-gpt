Constructive Mathematics
First published Tue Nov 18, 1997; substantive revision Thu Aug 25, 2022
Constructive mathematics is distinguished from its traditional
counterpart, classical mathematics, by the strict interpretation of
the phrase “there exists” as “we can
construct”. In order to work constructively, we need to
re-interpret not only the existential quantifier but all the logical
connectives and quantifiers as instructions on how to construct a
proof of the statement involving these logical expressions.
In this article we introduce modern constructive mathematics based on
the BHK-interpretation of the logical connectives and quantifiers. We
discuss four major varieties of constructive mathematics, with
particular emphasis on the two varieties associated with Errett Bishop
and Per Martin-Löf, which can be regarded as minimal constructive
systems. We then outline progress in (informal) constructive reverse
mathematics, a research programme seeking to identify principles, such
as Brouwer’s fan theorem, that, added to the minimal
constructive varieties, facilitate proofs of important analytic
theorems. After a brief discussion of constructive algebra, economics,
and finance, the entry ends with two appendices: one on certain
logical principles that hold in classical, intuitionistic, and
recursive mathematics and which, added to Bishop’s constructive
mathematics, facilitate the proof of certain useful theorems of
analysis; and one discussing approaches to a constructive development
of general topology.

1. Introduction
Before mathematicians assert something (other than an axiom) they are
supposed to have proved it true. What, then, do mathematicians mean
when they assert a disjunction \(P \vee Q\), where \(P\) and \(Q\) are
syntactically correct statements in some (formal or informal)
mathematical language? A natural — although, as we shall see,
not the unique — interpretation of this disjunction is that not
only does (at least) one of the statements \(P, Q\) hold, but also we
can decide which one holds. Thus just as mathematicians will assert
\(P\) only when they have decided that \(P\) holds by proving it, they
may assert \(P \vee Q\) only when they either can produce a proof of
\(P\) or else produce one of \(Q\).
With this interpretation, however, we run into a serious problem in
the special case where \(Q\) is the negation, \(\neg P\), of \(P\). To
assert \(\neg P\) is to show that \(P\) implies a contradiction (such
as \(0 = 1)\). But it will often be that mathematicians have neither a
proof of \(P\) nor one of \(\neg P\). To see this, we need only
reflect on the following
Goldbach conjecture
(GC):
Every even integer \(\gt 2\) can be written as a sum of two
primes,
which remains neither proved nor disproved despite the best efforts of
many of the leading mathematicians since it was first raised in a
letter from Goldbach to Euler in 1742. We are forced to conclude that,
under the very natural decidability interpretation of P
\(\vee Q\), only a stubborn optimist can retain a belief in the
law of excluded middle
(
LEM
):
For every statement \(P\), either \(P\) or \(\neg P\) holds.
Classical logic
gets round this by widening the interpretation of disjunction: it
interprets \(P \vee Q\) as \(\neg(\neg P\wedge \neg Q)\), or in other
words, “it is contradictory that both \(P\) and \(Q\) be
false”. In turn, this leads to the
idealistic
interpretation of existence, in which \(\exists xP(x)\) means \(\neg
\forall x\neg P(x)\) (“it is contradictory that \(P(x)\) be
false for every \(x\)”). It is on these interpretations of
disjunction and existence that mathematicians have built the grand,
and apparently impregnable, edifice of classical mathematics which
serves a foundation for the physical, the social, and (increasingly)
the biological sciences. However, the wider interpretations come at a
cost: for example, when we pass from our initial, natural
interpretation of \(P \vee Q\) to the unrestricted use of the
idealistic one, \(\neg(\neg P\wedge \neg Q)\), the resulting
mathematics cannot generally be interpreted within computational
models such as recursive function theory.
This point is illustrated by a well-worn example, the proposition:
There exist irrational numbers \(a, b\) such that \(a^b\) is
rational.
A slick classical proof goes as follows. Either
\(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) is rational, in which case we take \(a = b =
\sqrt{2}\); or else \(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) is irrational, in which
case we take \(a = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) and \(b = \sqrt{2}\) (see
Dummett 1977 [2000], 6). But as it stands, this proof does not enable
us to pinpoint which of the two choices of the pair \((a,b)\) has the
required property. In order to determine the correct choice of
\((a,b)\), we would need to decide whether \(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) is
rational or irrational, which is precisely to employ our initial
interpretation of disjunction with \(P\) the statement
“\(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) is rational”.
Here is another illustration of the difference between
interpretations. Consider the following simple statement about the set
\(\bR\) of real numbers:
\[
\tag{*} \forall x \in \bR (x = 0 \vee x \ne 0),
\]
where, for reasons that we divulge shortly, \(x \ne 0\) means that we
can find a rational number \(r\) with \(0 \lt r \lt \abs{x}\). A
natural computational interpretation of (*) is that we have a
procedure which, applied to any real number \(x\), either tells us
that \(x = 0\) or else tells us that \(x \ne 0\). (For example, such a
procedure might output 0 if \(x = 0\), and 1 if \(x \ne 0\).) However,
because the computer can handle real numbers only by means of finite
rational approximations, we have the problem of
underflow
, in
which a sufficiently small positive number can be misread as 0 by the
computer; so there cannot be a decision procedure that justifies the
statement (*). In other words, we cannot expect (*) to hold under our
natural computational interpretation of the quantifier \(\forall\) and
the connective \(\vee\).
Let’s examine this from another angle. Let \(G(n)\) act as
shorthand for the statement “\(2n + 2\) is a sum of two
primes”, where \(n\) ranges over the positive integers, and
define an infinite binary sequence \(\ba = (a_1 ,a_2,\ldots)\) as
follows:
\[
a_n =
\begin{cases}
0 &\text{if } G(k) \text{ holds for all } k \le n \\
1 &\text{if } \neg G(k) \text{ holds for some } k \le n \\
\end{cases}
\]
There is no question that \(\ba\) is a computationally well-defined
sequence, in the sense that we have an algorithm for computing \(a_n\)
for each \(n\): check the even numbers \(4,6,8,\ldots ,2n+2\) to
determine whether each of them is a sum of two primes; in that case,
set \(a_n = 0\), and in the contrary case, set \(a_n = 1\). Now
consider the real number whose \(n\)
th
binary digit is
\(a_n\):
\[\begin{align*}
x &= (0\cdot a_1 a_2 \cdots)_{2} \\
  &= 2^{-1}a_1 + 2^{-2}a_2 + \cdots \\
  &=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 2^{-n}a_n.
\end{align*}\]
If (*) holds under our computational interpretation, then we can
decide between the following two alternatives:
\(2^{-1}a_1 + 2^{-2}a_2 + \cdots = 0\), which implies that \(a_n =
0\) for every \(n\);
we can find a positive integer \(N\) such that \(2^{-1}a_1 +
2^{-2}a_2 + \cdots \gt 2^{-N}\).
In the latter case, by testing \(a_1 ,\ldots ,a_N\), we can find \(n
\le N\) such that \(a_n = 1\). Thus the computational interpretation
of (*) enables us to decide whether there exists \(n\) such that \(a_n
= 1\); in other words, it enables us to decide the status of the
Goldbach Conjecture. An example of this type, showing that a
constructive proof of some classical result \(P\) would enable us to
solve the Goldbach conjecture (and, by similar arguments, many other
hitherto open problems, such as the Riemann hypothesis), is called a
Brouwerian example
for, or even a
Brouwerian
counterexample
to, the statement \(P\) (though it is not a
counterexample in the normal sense of that word).
The use of the Goldbach Conjecture here is purely dramatic. For, the
argument of the preceding paragraph can be modified to show that,
under our computational interpretation, (*) implies the
limited
principle of omniscience
(
LPO
):
For each binary sequence \((a_1 ,a_2, \ldots)\) either \(a_n = 0\) for
all \(n\) or else there exists \(n\) such that \(a_n = 1\),
which is generally regarded as an essentially nonconstructive
principle for several reasons. First, its recursive
interpretation,
There is a recursive algorithm which, applied to any recursively
defined binary sequence \((a_1 ,a_2, \ldots)\), outputs 0 if \(a_n =
0\) for all \(n\), and outputs 1 if \(a_n = 1\) for some \(n\),
is provably false within recursive function theory, even with
classical logic (see Bridges & Richman [1987], Chapter 3); so if
we want to allow a recursive interpretation of all our mathematics,
then we cannot use LPO. Secondly, there is a model theory (Kripke
models) in which it can be shown that LPO is not constructively
derivable (Bridges & Richman [1987], Chapter 7).
2. The Constructive Interpretation of Logic
It should, by now, be clear that a full-blooded computational
development of mathematics disallows the idealistic interpretations of
disjunction and existence upon which most classical mathematics
depends. In order to work constructively, we need to return from the
classical interpretations to the natural constructive ones:
\(\vee\) (or):
to prove \(P \vee Q\) we must either have a proof of \(P\) or
have a proof of \(Q\).
\(\wedge\) (and):
to prove \(P \wedge Q\) we must have both a proof of \(P\) and a
proof of \(Q\).
\(\Rightarrow\) (implies):
a proof of \(P \rightarrow Q\) is an algorithm that converts any
proof of \(P\) into a proof of \(Q\).
\(\neg\) (not):
to prove \(\neg P\) we must show that \(P\) implies \(0 =
1\).
\(\exists\) (there exists):
to prove \(\exists xP(x)\) we must construct an object \(x\) and
prove that \(P(x)\) holds.
\(\forall\) (for each/all):
a proof of \(\forall x\in S P(x)\) is an algorithm that, applied
to any object \(x\) and to the data proving that \(x\in S\), proves
that \(P(x)\) holds.
These
BHK-interpretations
(the name reflects their origin in
the work of Brouwer, Heyting, and Kolmogorov) can be made more precise
using Kleene’s notion of
realizability
; see (Dummett
[1977/2000], 222–234; Beeson [1985], Chapter VII).
There is a common misunderstanding that constructive mathematics is
just mathematics without proofs by contradiction (reductio-ad-absurdum
arguments). This is
not
the case. Consider typical proofs
that \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational: these start with the assumption
'\(\sqrt{2}\) is rational', then proceed by elementary, and fully
constructive, steps to arrive at a contradiction. Such a procedure is
a perfectly constructive proof that \(\sqrt{2}\) is not rational;
indeed, the constructive interpretation of '\(\neg p\)' is precisely
that assuming \(p\) leads to a contradiction. The misunderstanding
alluded to at this start of this paragraph is caused by confusing a
proof, like the foregoing, of a negated statement with one of the
following type: assume \(\neg p\), derive a contradiction, and
conclude that \(p\) must hold. From a constructive point of view, the
most one can obtain from the latter type of proof is the conclusion
\(\neg\neg p\); the final step, claiming that \(p\) must hold, is
nonconstructive.
To reinforce this point, consider a proof of the form
Assume there is no such thing as a boojum; then argue constructively
to arrive at a contradiction.
Such a proof does not normally contain the algorithmic information
enabling us to establish
constructively
that there exists a
boojum after all. More formally, a constructive proof of \(\neg\neg
\exists x P(x)\) does not automatically allow us to conclude that
\(\exists x P(x)\).
To summarise: to prove \(\neg p\), we may, and normally do, assume
\(p\) and derive a contradiction. To prove \(p\), it is
not
enough
to assume \(\neg p\) and derive a contradiction.
We turn now to intuitionistic logic in practice. What sort of things
are we looking for if we are serious about developing mathematics in
such a way that when a theorem asserts the existence of an object
\(x\) with a property \(P(x)\), then the proof of the theorem embodies
algorithms for constructing \(x\) and for demonstrating, by whatever
calculations are necessary, that \(x\) has the property \(P(x)\). Here
are some examples of theorems, each followed by an informal
description of the requirements for its constructive proof.
For each real number \(x\), either \(x = 0\) or \(x \ne 0\).
Proof requirement
: An algorithm which, applied to a given
real number \(x\), decides whether \(x = 0\) or \(x \ne 0\). Note
that, in order to make this decision, the algorithm might use not only
the data describing \(x\) but also the data showing that \(x\) is
actually a real number.
Each nonempty subset \(S\) of \(\bR\)
that is bounded above
has a least upper bound
.
Proof requirement
: An algorithm which, applied to a set \(S\)
of real numbers, a member \(s\) of \(S\), and an upper bound for
\(S\),
computes an object \(b\) and shows that \(b\) is a real
number;
shows that \(x \le b\) for each \(x \in S\); and
given a real number \(b' \lt b\), computes an element \(x\) of
\(S\) such that \(x \gt b'\).
If \(f\) is a continuous real-valued mapping on the closed
interval \([0,1]\) such that \(f(0)\cdot f(1) \lt 0\), then there
exists \(x\) such that \(0 \lt x \lt 1\) and \(f(x) = 0\).
Proof requirement
: An algorithm which, applied to the
function \(f\), a modulus of continuity for \(f\), and the values
\(f(0)\) and \(f(1)\),
computes an object \(x\) and shows that \(x\) is a real number
between 0 and 1; and
shows that \(f(x) = 0\).
If \(f\) is a continuous real-valued mapping on the closed
interval \([0,1]\) such that \(f(0)\cdot f(1) \lt 0\), then for each
\(\varepsilon \gt 0\) there exists \(x\) such that \(0 \lt x \lt 1\)
and \(\abs{f(x)} \lt \varepsilon\).
Proof requirement
: An algorithm which, applied to the
function \(f\), a modulus of continuity for \(f\), the values \(f(0)\)
and \(f(1)\), and a positive number \(\varepsilon\),
computes an object \(x\) and shows that \(x\) is a real number
between 0 and 1; and
shows that \(\abs{f(x)} \lt \varepsilon\).
We already have reasons for doubting that (A) has a constructive
proof. If the proof requirements for (B) can be fulfilled, then, given
any mathematical statement \(P\), we can apply our proof of (B) to
compute a rational approximation \(z\) to the supremum \(\sigma\) of
the set
\[
S = \{0\} \cup \{x \in \bR: P \wedge x = 1\}
\]
with error \(\lt \bfrac{1}{4}\). We can then determine whether \(z \gt
\bfrac{1}{4}\), in which case \(\sigma \gt 0\), or \(z \lt
\bfrac{3}{4}\), when \(\sigma \lt 1\). In the first case, there exists
\(x \in S\) with \(x \gt 0\), so we must have \(x = 1\) and therefore
\(P\). In the case \(\sigma \lt 1\), we have \(\neg P\). Thus (B)
implies the law of excluded middle.
However, in Bishop’s constructive theory of the real numbers,
based on Cauchy sequences with a preassigned convergence rate, we can
prove the following
constructive least-upper-bound
principle
:
Let \(S\) be a nonempty subset of \(\bR\) that is bounded above. Then
\(S\) has a least upper bound if and only if it is
upper-order
located
, in the sense that for all real numbers \(\alpha ,
\beta\) with \(\alpha \lt \beta\), either \(\beta\) is an upper bound
for \(S\) or else there exists \(x \in S\) with \(x \gt \alpha\)
(Bishop & Bridges [1985], p. 37, Proposition (4.3)).
In passing, we mention an alternative development of the constructive
theory of \(\bR\) based on interval arithmetic; see Chapter 2 of
Bridges & Vîță [2006].
Each of statements (C) and (D), which are classically equivalent, is a
version of the Intermediate Value Theorem. In these statements, a
modulus of continuity
for \(f\) is a set \(\Omega\) of
ordered pairs \((\varepsilon ,\delta)\) of positive real numbers with
the following two properties:
for each \(\varepsilon \gt 0\) there exists \(\delta \gt 0\) such
that \((\varepsilon ,\delta) \in \Omega\)
for each \((\varepsilon , \delta) \in \Omega\), and for all \(x,y
\in [0,1]\) with \(\abs{x - y} \lt \delta\), we have \(\abs{f(x) -
f(y)} \lt \varepsilon\).
Statement (C) entails another essentially nonconstructive principle,
the
lesser limited principle of omniscience
(
LLPO
):
For each binary sequence \((a_1,a_2,\ldots)\) with at most one term
equal to 1, either \(a_n = 0\) for all even \(n\) or else \(a_n = 0\)
for all odd \(n\).
Statement (D), a weak form of (C), can be proved constructively, using
an interval-halving argument of a standard type. The following
stronger constructive intermediate value theorem, which suffices for
most practical purposes, is proved using an
approximate-interval-halving argument:
Let \(f\) be a continuous real-valued mapping on the closed interval
\([0,1]\) such that \(f(0)\cdot f(1) \lt 0\). Suppose also that \(f\)
is
locally nonzero
, in the sense that for each \(x \in
[0,1]\) and each \(r \gt 0\), there exists \(y\) such that \(\abs{x -
y} \lt r\) and \(f(y) \ne 0\). Then there exists \(x\) such that \(0
\lt x \lt 1\) and \(f(x) = 0\).
The situation of the intermediate value theorem is typical of many in
constructive analysis, where we find one classical theorem with
several constructive versions, some or all of which may be equivalent
under classical logic.
There is one omniscience principle whose constructive status is less
clear than that of
LPO
and
LLPO
—namely,
Markov’s principle
(
MP
):
For each binary sequence \((a_n)\), if it is contradictory that all
the terms \(a_n\) equal 0, then there exists a term equal to 1.
This principle is equivalent to a number of simple classical
propositions, including the following:
For each real number \(x\), if it is contradictory that \(x\)
equal 0, then \(x \ne 0\) (in the sense we mentioned earlier).
For each real number \(x\), if it is contradictory that \(x\)
equal 0, then there exists \(y \in \bR\) such that \(xy = 1\).
For each one-one continuous mapping \(f : [0,1] \rightarrow \bR\),
if \(x \ne y\), then \(f(x) \ne f(y)\).
Markov’s principle represents an unbounded search: if you have a
proof that all terms \(a_n\) being 0 leads to a contradiction, then,
by testing the terms \(a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots\) in turn, you are
guaranteed to come across a term equal to 1; but this guarantee does
not extend to an assurance that you will find the desired term before
the end of the universe. Most practitioners of constructive
mathematics view Markov’s principle with at least suspicion, if
not downright disbelief. Such views are reinforced by the observation
that there is a Kripke Model showing that
MP
is not
constructively derivable (Bridges & Richman [1987],
137–138.)
3. Varieties of Constructive Mathematics
The desire to retain the possibility of a computational interpretation
is one motivation for using the constructive reinterpretations of the
logical connectives and quantifiers that we gave above; but it is not
exactly the motivation of the pioneers of constructivism in
mathematics. In this section we look at some of the different
approaches to constructivism in mathematics over the past 130
years.
3.1 Intuitionistic Mathematics
In the late nineteenth century, certain individuals—most notably
Kronecker and Poincaré—had expressed doubts about, or
even disapproval of, the idealistic, nonconstructive methods used by
some of their contemporaries; but it is in the polemical writings of
L.E.J. Brouwer
(1881–1966), beginning with his Amsterdam doctoral thesis,
Brouwer [1907], and continuing over the next forty-seven years, that
the foundations of a precise, systematic approach to constructive
mathematics were laid. In Brouwer’s philosophy, known as
intuitionism
,
 mathematics is a free creation of the human mind, and an object
exists if and only if it can be (mentally) constructed. If one takes
that philosophical stance, then one is inexorably drawn to the
foregoing constructive interpretation of the logical connectives and
quantifiers: for how could a proof of the impossibility of the
non-existence of a certain object \(x\) describe a mental construction
of \(x\)?
Brouwer was not the clearest expositor of his ideas, as is shown by
the following quotation:
Mathematics arises when the subject of two-ness, which results from
the passage of time, is abstracted from all special occurrences. The
remaining empty form [the relation of \(n\) to \(n+1\)] of the common
content of all these two-nesses becomes the original intuition of
mathematics and repeated unlimitedly creates new mathematical
subjects. (quoted in Kline [1972], 1199–2000)
A modern version of Brouwer’s view was given by Errett Bishop
(Bishop [1967], p. 2):
The primary concern of mathematics is number, and this means the
positive integers. We feel about number the way Kant felt about space.
The positive integers and their arithmetic are presupposed by the very
nature of our intelligence and, we are tempted to believe, by the very
nature of intelligence in general. The development of the positive
integers from the primitive concept of the unit, the concept of
adjoining a unit, and the process of mathematical induction carries
complete conviction. In the words of Kronecker, the positive integers
were created by God.
However obscure Brouwer’s writings could be, one thing was
always clear: for him, mathematics took precedence over logic. One
might say, as Hermann Weyl did in the following passage, that Brouwer
saw classical mathematics as flawed precisely in its use of classical
logic without reference to the underlying mathematics:
According to [Brouwer’s] view and reading of history, classical
logic was abstracted from the mathematics of finite sets and their
subsets. … Forgetful of this limited origin, one afterwards
mistook that logic for something above and prior to all mathematics,
and finally applied it, without justification, to the mathematics of
infinite sets. This is the Fall and original sin of set theory, for
which it is justly punished by the antinomies. It is not that such
contradictions showed up that is surprising, but that they showed up
at such a late stage of the game. (Weyl [1946])
In particular, this misuse of logic led to nonconstructive existence
proofs which, in Weyl’s words, “inform the world that a
treasure exists without disclosing its location”.
In order to describe the logic used by the intuitionist mathematician,
it was necessary first to analyse the mathematical processes of the
mind, from which analysis the logic could be extracted. In 1930,
Brouwer’s most famous pupil, Arend Heyting, published a set of
formal axioms which so clearly characterise the logic used by the
intuitionist that they have become universally known as the axioms for
intuitionistic logic
(Heyting [1930]). These axioms captured the informal
BHK-interpretation of the connectives and quantifiers that we gave
earlier.
Intuitionistic mathematics,
INT
, diverges from other types of
constructive mathematics in its interpretation of the term
“sequence”. Normally, a sequence in constructive
mathematics is given by a rule which determines, in advance, how to
construct each of its terms; such a sequence may be said to be
lawlike
or
predeterminate
. Brouwer generalised this
notion of a sequence to include the possibility of constructing the
terms one-by-one, the choice of each term being made freely, or
subject only to certain restrictions stipulated in advance. Most
manipulations of sequences do not require that they be predeterminate,
and can be performed on these more general
free choice
sequences
.
Thus, for the intuitionist, a real number \(\bx = (x_1
,x_2,\ldots)\)—essentially, a Cauchy sequence of rational
numbers—need not be given by a rule: its terms \(x_1
,x_2,\ldots\), are simply rational numbers, successively constructed,
subject only to some kind of Cauchy restriction such as the following
one used by Bishop [1967]:
\[
\forall m\forall n \left[ \abs{x_m - x_n} \le \left(\frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n}\right)\right]
\]
Once free choice sequences are admitted into mathematics, so, perhaps
to one’s initial surprise, are certain strong choice principles.
Let \(P\) be a subset of \(\bN^{\bN} \times \bN\) (where \(\bN\)
denotes the set of natural numbers and, for sets \(A\) and \(B, B^A\)
denotes the set of mappings from \(A\) into \(B)\), and suppose that
for each \(\ba \in \bN^{\bN}\) there exists \(n \in \bN\) such that
\((\ba,n) \in P\). From a constructive point of view, this means that
we have a procedure, applicable to sequences, that computes \(n\) for
any given \(\ba\). According to Brouwer, the construction of an
element of \(\bN^{\bN}\) is forever incomplete: a generic sequence
\(\ba\) is
purely extensional
, in the sense that at any given
moment we can know nothing about \(\ba\) other than a finite set of
its terms. It follows that our procedure must be able to calculate,
from some finite initial sequence \((a_0 ,\ldots ,a_N)\) of terms of
\(\ba\), a natural number \(n\) such that \(P(\ba,n)\). If \(\bb \in
\bN^{\bN}\) is any sequence such that \(b_{k} = a_{k}\) for \(0 \le k
\le N\), then our procedure must return the same \(n\) for \(\bb\) as
it does for \(\ba\). This means that \(n\) is a continuous function of
\(\ba\) with respect to the topology on \(\bN^{\bN}\) given by the
metric
\[
\varrho : (\ba,\bb) \rightsquigarrow \inf\{2^{-n} : a_k = b_k 
 \text{ for } 0 \le k \le n\}.
\]
We are therefore led to the following
principle of continuous
choice
, which we divide into a continuity part and a choice part.
CC1
: Any function from \(\bN^{\bN}\) to \(\bN\) is continuous.
CC2
: If \(P \subseteq \bN^{\bN} \times \bN\), and for each
\(\ba \in \bN^{\bN}\) there exists \(n \in \bN\) such that \((\ba,n)
\in P\), then there is a function \(f : \bN^{\bN} \rightarrow \bN\)
such that \((\ba,f(\ba)) \in P\) for all \(\ba \in \bN^{\bN}\).
If \(P\) and \(f\) are as in CC2, then we say that \(f\) is a
choice function
for \(P\).
The omniscience principles LPO and LLPO are demonstrably false under
the hypotheses CC1–2; but MP is consistent with it. Among the
remarkable consequences of CC1–2 are the following.
Any function from \(\bN^{\bN}\) or \(2^{\bN}\) to a metric space
is pointwise continuous.
Every mapping from a nonempty complete separable metric space to a
metric space is pointwise continuous.
Every map from the real line \(\bR\) to itself is pointwise
continuous.
Let \(X\) be a complete separable normed space, \(Y\) a normed
space, and \((u_n)\) a sequence of linear mappings from \(X\) to \(Y\)
such that for each unit vector \(x\) of \(X\), 
\[
\phi(x) = \sup\{ \Vert u_n(x)\rVert : n \in \bN \}
\]
exists. Then there exists \(c \gt 0\) such that \(\lVert u_n (x)\rVert
\le c\) for all \(n\in \bN\) and all unit vectors \(x\) of \(X\)
(
Uniform boundedness principle
).
Each of these statements appears to contradict known classical
theorems. However, the comparison with classical mathematics should
not be made superficially: in order to understand that there is no
real contradiction here, we must appreciate that the meaning of such
terms as “function” and even “real number” in
intuitionistic mathematics is quite different from that in the
classical setting. (In practice, intuitionistic mathematics cannot be
compared, readily and directly, with classical mathematics.)
Brouwer’s introspection over the nature of functions and the
continuum led him to a second principle, which, unlike that of
continuous choice, is classically valid. This principle requires a
little more background for its explanation.
For any set \(S\) we denote by \(S^*\) the set of all finite sequences
of elements of \(S\), including the empty sequence \((\ )\). If
\(\alpha = (a_1 ,\ldots ,a_n)\) is in \(S^*\), then \(n\) is called
the
length
of \(\alpha\) and is denoted by \(\abs{\alpha}\).
If \(m \in \bN\), and \(\alpha\) is a finite or infinite sequence in
\(S\) of length at least \(m\), then we denote by \(\bar{\alpha}(m)\)
the finite sequence consisting of the first \(m\) terms of \(\alpha\).
Note that \(\bar{\alpha}(0) = (\ )\) and \(\abs{\bar{\alpha}(0)}\) = 0
. If \(\alpha \in S^*\) and \(\beta = \bar{\alpha}(m)\) for some
\(m\), we say that \(\alpha\) is an
extension
of \(\beta\),
and that \(\beta\) is a
restriction
of \(\alpha\).
A subset \(\sigma\) of \(S\) is said to be
detachable
(from
\(S)\) if
\[
\forall x\in S (x \in \sigma \vee x \not\in \sigma).
\]
A detachable subset \(\sigma\) of \(\bN^*\) is called a
fan
if
it is closed under restriction: for each \(\alpha \in \bN^*\) and
each \(n\), if \(\bar{\alpha}(n) \in S\), then \(\bar{\alpha}(k) \in
S\) whenever \(0 \le k \le n\); and
for each \(\alpha \in \sigma\), the set 
\[
\{ \alpha^* n \in S: n \in \bN \}
\]
is finite or empty, where \(\alpha^* n\) denotes the finite sequence
obtained by adjoining the natural number \(n\) to the terms of
\(\alpha\).
A
path
in a fan \(\sigma\) is a sequence \(\alpha\), finite
or infinite, such that \(\bar{\alpha}(n) \in \sigma\) for each
applicable \(n\). We say that a path \(\alpha\) is
blocked
by
a subset \(B\) if some restriction of \(\alpha\) is in \(B\); if no
restriction of \(\alpha\) is in \(B\), we say that \(\alpha\)
misses
\(B\). A subset \(B\) of a fan \(\sigma\) is called a
bar
for \(\sigma\) if each infinite path of \(\sigma\) is
blocked by \(B\); a bar \(B\) for \(\sigma\) is
uniform
if
there exists \(n \in \bN\) such that each path of length \(n\) is
blocked by \(B\).
At last we can state Brouwer’s next principle of intuitionism,
the fan theorem for detachable bars
(FT\(_D\)):
Every detachable bar of a fan is uniform.
In its classical contrapositive form, FT\(_D\) is known as
König’s Lemma
: if for every \(n\) there exists a
path of length \(n\) that misses \(B\), then there exists an infinite
path that misses \(B\) (see Dummett 1977 [2000], 49–53). (Of
course, classically the condition of detachability is superfluous.) It
is simple to construct a Brouwerian counterexample to
König’s Lemma.
Brouwer actually posited the fan theorem without the restriction of
detachability of the bar. Attempts to prove that more general fan
theorem constructively rely on an analysis of how we could know that a
subset is a bar, and led Brouwer to a notion of
bar
induction
; this is discussed in Section 3.6 of the entry on
intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics
;
 another good reference for bar induction is van Atten (2004). We
shall return to fan theorems in Section 4.
Of the many applications of Brouwer’s principles, the most
famous is his
uniform continuity theorem
(which follows from
the pointwise continuity consequences of CC1-2 together a form of fan
theorem more general than FT\(_D)\):
Every mapping from a compact (that is, complete, totally bounded)
metric space into a metric space is uniformly continuous.
The reader is warned once again to interpret this carefully within
Brouwer’s intuitionistic framework, and not to jump to the
erroneous conclusion that intuitionism contradicts classical
mathematics. It is more sensible to regard the two types of
mathematics as incomparable. For further discussion, see the entry on
intuitionistic logic
.
Unfortunately — and perhaps inevitably, in the face of
opposition from mathematicians of such stature as Hilbert —
Brouwer’s intuitionist school of mathematics and philosophy
became more and more involved in what, at least to classical
mathematicians, appeared to be quasi-mystical speculation about the
nature of constructive thought, to the detriment of the practice of
constructive mathematics itself. This unfortunate polarisation between
the Brouwerians and the Hilbertians culminated in the notorious
Grundlagenstreit of the 1920s, details of which can be found in the
Brouwer biographies by van Dalen [1999, 2005] and van Stigt
[1990].
3.2 Recursive Constructive Mathematics
In the late 1940s, the Russian mathematician A.A. Markov began the
development of an alternative form of constructive mathematics,
RUSS
, which is, essentially,
recursive function
theory with intuitionistic logic (Markov [1954], Kushner [1985]). In
this variety the objects are defined by means of
Gödel-numberings, and the procedures are all recursive; the main
distinction between RUSS and the classical recursive analysis
developed after the work of Turing, Church, and others in 1936
clarified the nature of computable processes is that the logic used in
RUSS is intuitionistic.
One obstacle faced by the mathematician attempting to come to grips
with RUSS is that, being expressed in the language of recursion
theory, it is not easily readable; indeed, on opening a page of
Kushner’s excellent lectures [1985], one might be forgiven for
wondering whether this is analysis or logic. (This remark should be
tempered with reference to the two relatively readable books on
classical recursive analysis by Aberth [1980, 2001].) Fortunately, one
can get to the heart of RUSS by an axiomatic approach due to Richman
[1983] (see also Chapter 3 of Bridges & Richman [1987]).
First, we define a set \(S\) to be
countable
if there is a
mapping from a detachable subset of \(\bN\) onto \(S\). With
intuitionistic logic we cannot prove that every subset of \(\bN\) is
detachable (the reader is invited to provide a Brouwerian example to
demonstrate this). Countable subsets of \(\bN\) in Richman’s
axiomatic approach are the counterparts of recursively enumerable sets
in the normal development of RUSS.
By a
partial function
on \(\bN\) we mean a mapping whose
domain is a subset of \(\bN\); if the domain is \(\bN\) itself, then
we call the function a
total function
on \(\bN\).
Richman’s approach to RUSS is based on intuitionistic logic and
a single axiom of
computable partial functions
(
CPF
):
There is an enumeration \(\phi_0 ,\phi_1,\ldots\) of the set of all
partial functions from \(\bN\) to \(\bN\) with countable domains.
It is remarkable what can be deduced cleanly and quickly using this
principle. For example, we can prove the following result, which
almost immediately shows that
LLPO
, and hence
LPO
, are
false in the recursive setting.
There is a total function \(f : \bN \times \bN \rightarrow \{0,1\}\)
such that
for each \(m\) there exists at most one \(n\) such that \(f(m,n) =
1\); and
for each total function \(f : \bN \rightarrow \{0,1\}\), there
exist \(m,k\) in \(\bN\) such that \(f(m,2k+f(m)) = 1\).
Of more interest, however, are results such as the following within
RUSS.
Specker’s Theorem
(Specker [1949]): There exists a
strictly increasing sequence \((r_1 ,r_2,\ldots)\) of rational numbers
in the closed interval \([0,1]\) such that for each \(x \in \bR\)
there exist \(N \in \bN\) and \(\delta \gt 0\) such that \(\abs{x -
r_n} \ge \delta\) for all \(n \ge N\).
For each \(\varepsilon \gt 0\), there exists a sequence \((I_1
,I_2,\ldots)\), of bounded open intervals in \(\bR\) such that \(\bR
\subseteq \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty} I_n\) and \(\sum_{n=1}^N \abs{I_n}
\lt \varepsilon\) for each N. (Such a sequence of intervals is called
an \(\varepsilon\)-
singular cover
of \(\bR\).)
There exists a pointwise continuous function \(f : [0,1]
\rightarrow \bR\) that is not uniformly continuous.
There exists a positive-valued uniformly continuous function \(f :
[0,1] \rightarrow \bR\) whose infimum is 0.
From a classical viewpoint, these results fit into place when one
realises that words such as “function” and “real
number” should be interpreted as “recursive
function” and “recursive real number” respectively.
Note that the second of the above four recursive theorems is a strong
recursive counterexample to the open-cover compactness property of the
(recursive) real line; and the fourth is a recursive counterexample to
the classical theorem that every uniformly continuous mapping of a
compact set into \(\bR\) attains its infimum.
3.3 Bishop’s Constructive Mathematics
Progress in all varieties of constructive mathematics was relatively
slow throughout the next decade and a half. What was needed to raise
the profile of constructivism in mathematics was a top-ranking
classical mathematician to show that a thoroughgoing constructive
development of deep analysis was possible without a commitment to
Brouwer’s non-classical principles or to the machinery of
recursive function theory. This need was fulfilled in 1967, with the
appearance of Errett Bishop’s monograph
Foundations of
Constructive Analysis
[1967] (see also Bishop & Bridges
[1985]), the product of an astonishing couple of years in which,
working in the informal but rigorous style used by normal analysts,
Bishop provided a constructive development of a large part of
twentieth-century analysis, including the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem,
the Hahn-Banach and separation theorems, the spectral theorem for
self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space, the Lebesgue convergence
theorems for abstract integrals, Haar measure and the abstract Fourier
transform, ergodic theorems, and the elements of Banach algebra
theory. Thus, at a stroke, he gave the lie to the commonly-held view
expressed so forcefully by Hilbert:
Taking the principle of excluded middle from the mathematician would
be the same, say, as proscribing the telescope to the astronomer or to
the boxer the use of his fists. (Hilbert [1928])
Not only did Bishop’s mathematics,
BISH
, have the
advantage of readability — if you open Bishop’s book at
any page, what you see is clearly recognisable as analysis, even if,
from time to time, his moves in the course of a proof may appear
strange to one schooled in the use of the law of excluded middle
— but, unlike intuitionistic or recursive mathematics, it admits
many different interpretations. Intuitionistic mathematics, recursive
constructive mathematics, and even classical mathematics all provide
models of BISH. In fact, the results and proofs in BISH can be
interpreted, with at most minor amendments, in any reasonable model of
computable mathematics, such as, for example, Weihrauch’s Type
Two Effectivity Theory (Weihrauch [2000]; Bauer [2005]).
How is this multiple interpretability achieved? At least in part by
Bishop’s refusal to pin down his primitive notion of
“algorithm” or, in his words, “finite
routine”. This refusal has led to the criticism that his
approach lacks the precision that a logician would normally expect of
a foundational system. However, this criticism can be overcome by
looking more closely at what practitioners of BISH actually do when
they prove theorems: in practice, they are doing
mathematics with
intuitionistic logic
. Experience shows that the restriction to
intuitionistic logic always forces mathematicians to work in a manner
that, at least informally, can be described as algorithmic; so
algorithmic mathematics appears to be equivalent to mathematics
that uses only intuitionistic logic
. If that is the case, then we
can practice constructive mathematics using intuitionistic logic on
any reasonably defined mathematical objects, not just some class of
“constructive objects”.
This view, more or less, appears to have first been put forward by
Richman [1990, 1996]. Taking the logic as the primary characteristic
of constructive mathematics, it does not reflect the primacy of
mathematics over logic that was part of the belief of Brouwer,
Heyting, Markov, Bishop, and other pioneers of constructivism. On the
other hand, it does capture the essence of constructive mathematics in
practice.
Thus one might distinguish between the
ontological
constructivism
of Brouwer and others who are led to constructive
mathematics through a belief that mathematical objects are mental
creations, and the
epistemological constructivism
of Richman
and those who see constructive mathematics as characterised by its
methodology, based on the use of intuitionistic logic. Of course, the
former approach to constructivism inevitably leads to the latter; and
the latter is certainly not inconsistent with a Brouwerian
ontology.
To do actual mathematics we need more than just intutionistic logic.
For Bishop, the building blocks of mathematics were the positive
integers (see the quote from Bishop [1967] in Section 3.1 above).
Among the early formal systems for BISH were Myhill’s
[1975] axiomatic foundation based on primitive notions of number, set,
and function; Feferman’s [1975] system for
explicit
mathematics
; and Friedman’s [1977] intuitionistic ZF set
theory. The two most favoured formal underpinnings of BISH at
this stage are
constructive Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory
(CZF),
 in Aczel and Rathjen [2010, in Other Internet Resources], and
intuitionistic type theory
,
 in Martin-Löf [1975, 1984].
3.4 Martin-Löf’s Constructive Type Theory
Before ending our tour of varieties of modern constructive
mathematics, we visit a fourth variety,
ML
, based on Per
Martin-Löf’s
intuitionistic type theory
.
 Martin-Löf published his
Notes on Constructive
Mathematics
[1968], based on lectures he had given in Europe in
1966–68; so his involvement with constructivism in mathematics
goes back at least to the period of Bishop’s writing of
Foundations of Constructive Analysis
. Martin-Löf’s
book is in the spirit of RUSS, rather than BISH; indeed, its author
did not have access to Bishop’s book until his own manuscript
was finished. Martin-Löf later turned his attention to his theory
of types as a foundation for Bishop-style constructive mathematics.
Here, in his own words, is an informal explanation of the ideas
underlying ML:
We shall think of
mathematical objects
or
constructions
. Every mathematical object is of a certain kind
or
type
[… and] is always given together with its
type. … A type is defined by describing what we have to do in
order to construct an object of that type. … Put differently, a
type is well-defined if we understand … what it means to be an
object of that type. Thus, for instance \(\bN \rightarrow \bN\)
[functions from \(\bN\) to \(\bN\)] is a type, not because we know
particular number theoretic functions like the primitive recursive
ones, but because we think we understand the notion of number
theoretic function
in general
. (Martin-Löf [975])
In particular, in this system every proposition can be represented as
a type: namely, the type of proofs of the proposition. Conversely,
each type determines a proposition: namely, the proposition that the
type in question is inhabited. So when we think of a certain type
\(T\) as a proposition, we interpret the formula
\[
x \in T
\]
as “\(x\) is a proof of the proposition \(T\)”.
Martin-Löf goes on to construct new types, such as Cartesian
products and disjoint unions, from old. For example, the Cartesian
product
\[
(\Pi x \in A) B(x)
\]
is the type of functions that take an arbitrary object \(x\) of type
\(A\) into an object of type \(B(x)\). In the propositions-as-proofs
interpretation, where \(B(x)\) represents a proposition, the above
Cartesian product corresponds to the universal proposition
\[
(\forall x \in A) B(x).
\]
Martin-Löf distinguishes carefully between proofs and
derivations: a
proof object
is a witness to the fact that
some proposition has been proved; whereas a
derivation
is the
record of the construction of a proof object. Also, he exercises two
basic forms (one dare not say “types” here) of
judgement
. The first is a relation between proof objects and
propositions, the second a property of some propositions. In the first
case, the judgement is either one that a proof object \(a\) is a
witness to a proposition \(A\), or else one that two proof objects
\(a\) and \(b\) are equal and both witness that \(A\) has been proved.
The first case of the second form of judgement states that a
proposition \(A\) is well-formed, and the second records that two
propositions \(A\) and \(B\) are equal.
There is a careful, and highly detailed, set of rules for formalising
ML. We will not go into those here, but refer the reader to other
sources such as Sambin & Smith [1998].
When actually doing constructive mathematics in type theory, one often
needs to equip completely presented sets (types) with an equivalence
relation, the combination being known as a
setoid
. Mappings
are then functions that respect those equivalence relations. This is
in close agreement with the way Bishop presented his informal theory
of sets. The dependent types of Martin-Löf are useful for
constructing subsets. For instance, the real numbers can be
constructed using the \(\Sigma\)-type (see Martin-Löf
[1984]):
\[
(\Sigma x \in \bN_+\rightarrow \bQ)(\Pi m \in \bN_+)(\Pi n \in \bN_+)\left[\abs{x_{m} - x_{n}} \le \left(\frac{1}{m} + \frac{1}{n}\right)\right],
\]
An element of this type \(B\) is thereby a pair consisting of a
convergent sequence \(\bx\) of rationals and a proof \(p\) that it is
convergent. A suitable equivalence relation \({\sim}\) on \(R\) is
defined by taking \((x,p)\sim(y,q)\) to mean
\[
\forall m \in \bN_+ \left(\abs{x_{m} - y_{m}} \le  \frac{2}{m}\right).
\]
The resulting
setoid of real numbers
is \(\bR = (R,{\sim})\).
We can readily prove that
\[
\forall x \in \bR\, \exists n \in Z (n \lt x \lt n+2)
\]
and then, using the type-theoretic axiom of choice (see Section 4
below), find a function \(f : \bR\rightarrow \bZ\) such that \(f(x)
\lt x \lt f(x)+2\). However, there is no reason to believe that the
function \(f\) respects the equivalence relations—that is, that
\(f(x) = f(y)\) holds if \(x \sim y\).
Every constructive proof embodies an algorithm that, in principle, can
be extracted and recast as a computer program; moreover, the
constructive proof is itself a verification that the algorithm is
correct — that is, meets its specification. One major advantage
of Martin-Löf’s formal approach to constructive mathematics
is that it greatly facilitates the extraction of programs from proofs.
This has led to serious work on the implementation of constructive
mathematics in various locations (see Martin-Löf [1980],
Constable [1986], Hayashi & Nakano [1988], Schwichtenberg [2009]).
Some recent implementations of type theory for proof extraction are
Coq and Agda (see the links in Other Internet Resources).
4. Axioms of Choice and the Continuum Hypothesis
The full axiom of choice can be stated as follows:
If \(A,B\) are inhabited sets, and \(S\) a subset of \(A \times B\)
such that
\[
\forall x\in A\,\exists y\in B((x,y) \in S),
\]
then there exists a
choice function
\(f : A \rightarrow B\)
such that
\[
\forall x\in A  ((x,f(x)) \in S).
\]
Now, if this is to hold under a constructive interpretation, then for
a given \(x \in A\), the value \(f(x)\) of the choice function will
depend not only on \(x\)
but also on the data proving that \(x\)
belongs to \(A.\)
In general, we cannot expect to produce a
choice function of this sort. However, the BHK interpretation of the
hypotheses in the axiom is that there is an algorithm \(\mathcal{A}\)
which, applied to any given \(x \in A\), produces an element \(y \in
B\) such that \((x,y) \in S\). If \(A\) is a
completely presented
set
, one for which no work beyond the construction of each
element in the set is required to prove that the element does indeed
belong to \(A\), then we might reasonably expect the algorithm
\(\mathcal{A}\) to be a choice function. In Martin-Löf’s
type theory,
every set is completely presented
and, in
keeping with the BHK interpretation, the axiom of choice is
derivable.
On the other hand, in Bishop-style mathematics, completely
presented–––or, in his terminology,
basic
–––sets are rare, one example being
\(\bN\); so we might expect that the axiom of choice would not be
derivable. In fact, as was shown by Diaconescu [1975] and Goodman
& Myhill [1978], and prefigured by Bishop himself in Problem 2 on
page 58 of Bishop 1967, the axiom of choice implies the law of
excluded middle. Clearly, the Diaconescu-Goodman-Myhill theorem
applies only under the assumption that not every set is completely
presented.
Constructive mathematicians not working in ML typically reject the
full axiom of choice but embrace the axiom of countable choice, in
which the domain of choice is \(\bN\), and dependent choice. But some
prefer to work without even countable choice, on the grounds that to
speak of an infinity of choices without giving a rule presents a
difficulty that is just as great whether or not the infinity is
denumerable. Interestingly, Lebesgue made precisely this point in a
letter to Borel (see Moore [2013], page 316):
I agree completely with Hadamard when he states that to speak of an
infinity of choices without giving a rule presents a difficulty that
is just as great whether or not the infinity is denumerable.
The effect of abandoning even countable choice is the exclusion of
many theorems that, as they stand, are proved using sequential,
choice-based arguments. But those who advocate avoiding choice would
argue that avoiding choice forces you to formulate things better.
A particular case of interest is the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra:
every complex polynomial has at least one root in the complex plane.
Richman [2000] has shown that without countable choice, although we
can construct only isolated (possibly multiple) roots, we can
construct arbitrarily close approximations to the multiset of roots.
Such an approach focusses on finding an approximate linear
factorization of the polynomial, rather than on finding separate
approximations to each of its roots.
For further analysis of the axiom of choice in set theory and type
theory see Martin-Löf [2006], and the SEP entries on
category theory
,
type theory
, and
intuitionistic type theory
.
We now recall the
power set axiom
of classical set theory: if
\(X\) is a set, then so is its
power set
\[
\textrm{sb}(X)≡ \{S: S \subset X\}.
\]
 Since
this definition is impredicative, most constructive mathematicians
hesitate to regard \(\textrm{sb}(X)\) as a set. What they normally
use, and we shall adopt, as the constructive replacement for the power
set axiom is the
axiom of exponentiation
: If \(A\) and \(B\)
are sets, then so is the set of all mappings from \(A\) into \(B\). In
particular, the class \(2^{\bN}\) of all binary sequences is a set.
In order to discuss the Continuum Hypothesis, we need notions of
comparative size for classes \(A\) and \(B\). We say that
\(A\) is
equinumerous with
\(B\) if there exists a
bijective mapping of \(A\) onto \(B\), and that
\(A\) is
cardinally included in
\(B\) if \(A\) is
equinumerous with a subclass of \(B\).
In the first case we write \(A\) ≅ \(B\), and in the
second, \(A ≲ B\).
A consequence of the axiom of replacement in constructive
Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory,
CZF
,
 is that if \(A\) is a set and \(B\) is a class that is equinumerous
with \(A\), then \(B\) is also a set. It follows that the class

\[
\textrm{dch}(\bN)≡ \{S \subset\bN : \forall x \in \bN (x \in S \vee x \not\in S)\}
\]
 of detachable subsets of \(\bN\), being equivalent to
\(2^{\bN}\), is a set.
Classically, every subset of \(\bN\) is detachable from \(\bN\), so
\(\textrm{dch}(\bN)\) = \(\textrm{sb}(\bN)\). But this is not the case
constructively: if for each statement \(p\) the set 
\[
\{x \in 1 : p \vee \neg p \}
\]
 were
in \(\textrm{dch}(\bN)\), then we could derive the law of excluded
middle.
The
classical Continuum Hypothesis
states that there is no
set whose cardinality lies strictly between that of the set \(\bN\)
and that of \(\textrm{sb}(\bN)\). We can state this more formally as
follows: 
\[
\forall C(\bN ≲ C≲ \textrm{sb}(\bN) \Rightarrow C \cong \bN \vee C \cong \textrm{sb}(\bN))
\]
 or, equivalently, 
\[
\forall C(\bN ≲ C≲ \textrm{sb}(\bN) \wedge \neg(C ≲  \bN) \Rightarrow C \cong \textrm{sb}(\bN))
\]
 Constructively
acceptable classical equivalents of these two statements are:

\[
\forall C(\bN ≲ C ≲ \textrm{dch}(\bN) \Rightarrow C \cong \bN \vee C \cong \textrm{dch}(\bN))
\]
 and the one that we take as our
constructive
Continuum Hypothesis
, \(\textrm{CH}\), 
\[
\forall C(\bN ≲ C≲ \textrm{dch}(\bN) \wedge \neg(C \cong \bN) \Rightarrow C \cong \textrm{dch}(\bN))
\]
We sketch a proof that \(\textrm{CH}\) implies the law of excluded
middle. First we note that \(2^{\bN}\) is uncountable in the strong
sense: Cantor’s diagonal argument shows that if \(S\) is a countable
subset of \(2^{\bN}\), then there exists \(f \in 2^{\bN}\) such that
\(f \notin S\). Assuming \(\textrm{CH}\), we now define 
\[
X≡ \{S \in \textrm{dch}(\bN) : p \vee \neg p \}\]

and 
\[
\textrm{C}≡\bN \cup X.
\]
 Then \(\bN ≲C≲\textrm{dch}(\bN)\). If \(C
\cong \bN \), then \(p \vee \neg p \) is false, which is absurd. Hence
\(\neg (C \cong \bN)\) and therefore \(C \cong \textrm{dch}(\bN)\).
But \(\textrm{dch}(\bN)\), being equinumerous with \(2^{\bN}\) , is
uncountable, so there exists \(S \in \textrm{dch}(\bN)\) that does not
belong to the countable subset \(\bN\) of \(\textrm{dch}(\bN)\). Thus
\(S \in C \), and therefore \(p \vee \neg p \) holds.
Incidentally, although, in light of the BHK interpretation of
'\(\vee\)', the first of our two constructive statements classically
equivalent to the classical Continuum Hypothesis might appear to be
stronger than \(\textrm{CH}\), since the latter implies the law of
excluded middle it is constructively equivalent to the former.
The foregoing work on \(\textrm{CH}\) can be formalised in
CZF
,
 which is equiconsistent with classical Zermelo–Fraenkel set
theory,
ZF
.
 If we allow ourselves to invoke the Gödel–Cohen theorem
that the Continuum Hypothesis is independent of ZF, then we can draw
some interesting conclusions by looking more closely at our proof that
\(\textrm{CH}\) implies LEM. To do so, take \(p=\textrm{CH}\) in our
proof, so that 
\[
X≡ \{S \in \textrm{dch}(\bN) : \textrm {CH} \vee \neg \textrm{CH} \}.
\]
 If \(X=0\), then \(\neg (\textrm{CH} \vee
\neg \textrm{CH})\), which is absurd; so \(\neg(X=0)\). On the other
hand, if \(X\) is inhabited — that is, contains a point —
then \(\textrm{CH} \vee \neg \textrm{CH}\), so under the constructive
interpretation of '\(\vee\)', either we have a proof of
\(\textrm{CH}\) or else we have a proof of \(\neg \textrm{CH}\). Since
this runs counter to the aforementioned Gödel–Cohen
theorem, we may regard \(X\) as an explicit example of a set that is
not empty but for which it is impossible to construct a member. This,
in itself, is not uninteresting; but it also gives a new insight into
the constructive status of \(\textrm{CH}\). From our proof that
\(\textrm{CH}\) implies LEM we see that the set \(C≡\bN \cup X\)
satisfies 
\[
    \bN≲C≲\textrm{dch}(\bN) \wedge \neg(C \cong \bN).
    \]
 Also, 
\[
    \neg(C \cong \textrm{dch}(\bN)) \Rightarrow X=0,
    \]
 which is absurd, so
\(\neg\neg(C \cong \textrm{dch}(\bN))\). On the other hand,

\[
C \cong \textrm{dch}(\bN) \Rightarrow \textrm{CH} \vee \neg \textrm{CH}.
\]
 Thus, provided \(\textrm{CH}\) is independent of CZF
(which, in view of equiconsistency of CZF and ZF, it had better be),
we see that \(C\) is an explicit example of a set that has the
property 
\[
    \bN≲C≲\textrm{dch}(\bN) \wedge \neg(C\cong \bN) \wedge \neg \neg (C \cong \textrm{dch}(\bN))
    \]
 but, within CZF, cannot be proved equinumerous
with \(\textrm{dch}(\bN)\).
5. Constructive Reverse Mathematics
In the 1970s, Harvey Friedman initiated a research programme of
reverse mathematics,
aiming to classify mathematical theorems
according to their equivalence to one of a small number of
set-theoretic principles (Friedman 1975). This classification reveals
interesting, sometimes remarkable, differences in proof-theoretic
complexity. For example, although the Ascoli–Arzelà
theorem is used in the standard proof of Peano’s existence
theorem for solutions of ordinary differential equations (Hurewicz
[1958], page 10), a reverse-mathematical analysis shows that the
former is equivalent to a strictly stronger set-theoretic principle
than the one equivalent to Peano’s theorem (Simpson [1984],
Theorems 3.9 and 4.2). The standard treatise on classical reverse
mathematics is (Simpson [1999/2009]).
Around the turn of this century, Veldman (see Other Internet
Resources), in the Netherlands, and Ishihara [2005, 2006], in Japan,
independently initiated a programme of
constructive reverse
mathematics
(CRM), based on intuitionistic, rather than
classical, logic. (Note, though, that the first published work in the
modern era of CRM is probably that of Julian and Richman [1984], which
was twenty years ahead of its time.) In this section of the article,
we describe a less formal approach to CRM, in the style and framework
of BISH. The aim of that CRM program is to classify the theorems in
the three standard models—CLASS, INT, and RUSS—according
to which principles we must, and need only, add to BISH in order to
prove them.
We stress that we restrict ourselves here to
informal
CRM, in
which we take for granted the principles of function- and
set-construction described in the first chapters of Bishop [1967] or
Bishop & Bridges [1985], and we work in the informal, though
rigorous, style of the practising analyst, algebraist, topologist,
… .
In practice, CRM splits naturally into two parts. In the first of
these, we consider a theorem \(T\) of INT or RUSS, and try to find
some principle, valid in that model and other than \(T\) itself, whose
addition to BISH is necessary and sufficient for a constructive proof
of \(T\). In the second part of CRM we deal with a theorem \(T\) of
CLASS that we suspect is nonconstructive, and we try to prove that
\(T\) is equivalent, over BISH, to one of a number of known
essentially-nonconstructive principles, such as MP, LLPO, LPO, or LEM.
For an example of this part of CRM, we mention our earlier proof that
the classical least-upper-bound principle implies, and hence is
equivalent to, LEM.
Incidentally, there is a strong argument for Brouwer [1921] being the
first to deal with reverse-mathematical ideas: his Brouwerian
counterexamples (see the one using the Goldbach conjecture, in Section
1 above) lie squarely in the second part of CRM. Even if Brouwer did
not state those examples as logical equivalences, but as implications
of the type
\[
P \Rightarrow \text{ some nonconstructive principle},
\]
it is hard to believe that he was unaware that the right-hand-side
implied the left in such cases.
5.1 Fan theorems in CRM
To illustrate the first part of CRM, we now concentrate on theorems of
the type
\[
\text{BISH } \vdash \text{ FT}_? \Leftrightarrow T,
\]
where FT\(_?\) is some form of Brouwer’s fan theorem, and \(T\)
is a theorem of INT. To do so, we need to distinguish between certain
types of bar for the
complete binary fan
\(2^*\) (the set of
all finite sequences in \(\{0,1\})\).
Let \(\alpha \equiv (\alpha_1 ,\alpha_2, \ldots)\) be a finite or
infinite binary sequence. The
concatenation
of \(\alpha\)
with another string \(\beta\) is
\[
\alpha^{\frown}\beta \equiv 
(\alpha_1 ,\alpha_2 ,\ldots ,\alpha_n ,\beta_1 ,\ldots ,\beta_m).
\]
For \(b\) in \(\{0,1\}\) we write \(\alpha^{\frown}b\) rather than
\(\alpha^{\frown}(b)\). By a \(\mathsf{c}\)-
subset
of \(2^*\)
we mean a subset \(B\) of \(2^*\) such that
\[\tag{1}
B = \{u \in 2^* : \forall v\in 2^* (u^{\frown}v \in D)\}
\]
for some detachable subset \(D\) of \(2^*\). Every detachable subset
of \(2^*\) is a \(\mathsf{c}\)-subset. On the other hand, by a
\(\Pi^{0}_1\)-
subset
of \(2^*\) we mean a subset \(B\) of
\(2^*\) with the following property: there exists a detachable subset
\(S\) of \(2^* \times \bN\) such that
\[
\forall u\in 2^*\,\forall n\in \bN\,
 ((u,n) \in S \Rightarrow (u^{\frown}0,n) \in S \wedge 
  (u^{\frown}1,n) \in S)
\]
and
\[
B = \{u \in 2^* :\forall n\in \bN((u,n) \in S)\}.
\]
Every \(\mathsf{c}\)-subset \(B\) of \(2^*\) is a
\(\Pi^{0}_1\)-subset: simply take \(S = D \times \bN\), where \(D\) is
a detachable subset of \(2^*\) such that (1) holds.
If \(?\) denotes a property of subsets of \(2^*\), then
Brouwer’s
fan theorem for
\(?\)-
bars
tells us
that every bar with the property \(?\) is a uniform bar. We are
particularly interested in the fan theorem for detachable bars
(already discussed in Section 3.1):
FT\(_D\): Every detachable bar of the complete binary fan is uniform;
the fan theorem for \(\mathsf{c}\)-
bars
(that is, bars that
are \(\mathsf{c}\)-subsets):
FT\(_{\mathsf{c}}\): Every c-bar of the complete binary fan is
uniform;
the fan theorem for \(\Pi^{0}_1\)-
bars
(that is, bars that
are \(\Pi^{0}_1\)-subsets):
FT\(_{\Pi^{0}_1}\): Every \(\Pi^{0}_1\)-bar of the complete binary fan
is uniform;
and the full fan theorem:
FT: Every bar of the complete binary fan is uniform.
Note that, relative to BISH,
FT \(\Rightarrow\) FT\(_{\Pi^{0}_1} \Rightarrow\) FT\(_c \Rightarrow\)
FT\(_D\).
Lubarsky and Diener [2014] have shown that these implications are
strict.
Typically, we want to prove that FT\(_?\) is equivalent, over BISH, to
the proposition that, for every set \(S\) of an appropriate sort, some
pointwise property of the form
\[\tag{2}
\forall x \in S \exists t \in T P(s,t)
\]
actually holds uniformly in the form
\[\tag{3}
\exists t \in T \forall s \in S P(s,t).
\]
Our strategy for attacking this problem is two-fold. First, given a
set \(S\) of the appropriate sort, we construct a ?-subset \(N\) of
\(2^*\) such that
if (2) holds, then \(B\) is a bar, and
if \(B\) is a uniform bar, then (3) holds.
This, though, is only half of the solution. To prove that the
implication from (3) to (2) implies FT\(_?\), we consider a ?-subset
\(B\) of \(2^*\) and construct a corresponding set \(S\) such that
if \(B\) is a bar, then (2) holds, and
if (3) holds, then \(B\) is a uniform bar.
The canonical example of such results is that of Julian and Richman
[1984], in which \(S\) is the set of values of a given uniformly
continuous mapping \(f : [0,1] \rightarrow \bR, T\) is the set of
positive real numbers, and
\[
P(s,t) \equiv (s \ge t).
\]
The pointwise property we consider is
\[
\forall x \in [0,1] \exists t \gt 0 (f(x) \ge t),
\]
its uniform version being
\[
\exists t \gt 0 \forall x \in [0,1] (f(x) \ge t).
\]
The Julian-Richman results are as follows.
Theorem 1
: Let \(f : [0,1] \rightarrow \bR\) be
uniformly continuous. Then there exists a detachable subset \(B\) of
\(2^*\) such that
if \(f(x) \gt 0\) for each \(x \in [0,1]\), then \(B\) is a bar,
and
if \(B\) is a uniform bar, then \(\inf f \gt 0\).
Theorem 2
: Let \(B\) be a detachable subset of
\(2^*\). Then there exists a uniformly continuous \(f : [0,1]
\rightarrow \bR\) such that
if \(B\) is a bar, then \(f(x) \gt 0\) for each \(x \in [0,1]\),
and
if inf \(f \gt 0\), then \(B\) is a uniform bar.
The proofs of these two theorems are subtle and tricky; see Julian
& Richman [1984].
The two Julian-Richman theorems together reveal that, relative to
BISH, the fan theorem FT\(_D\) is equivalent to the
positivity
principle
,
POS
:
Each positive-valued, uniformly continuous function on \([0,1]\) has a
positive infimum.
It follows that POS is derivable in INT, in which the full fan
theorem, not just FT\(_D\), is a standard principle. The situation is
quiet the opposite in RUSS, where there exist both a detachable bar of
\(2^*\) that is not uniform and a positive-valued, uniformly
continuous function on \([0,1]\) that has infimum equal to 0; see
Chapters 5 and 6 of Bridges & Richman [1987].
Berger and Ishihara [2005] have taken a different, indirect route to
establishing the equivalence of POS and FT\(_c\). They establish a
chain of equivalences between POS, FT\(_c\), and four principles of
the type “if there is at most one object with property \(P\),
then there is one such object”. The four unique-existence
principles are:
CIN!
:   Each descending sequence of inhabited
closed located subsets of a compact metric space with at most one
common point has inhabited intersection (Cantor’s intersection
theorem with uniqueness.) Note that a subset \(S\) of a metric space
\((X,\rho)\) is
located
if for each \(x\) in \(X\) the
infimum distance from \(x\) to \(S\) exists.
MIN!
:   Each uniformly continuous, real-valued
function on a compact metric space with at most one minimum point has
a minimum point.
WKL!
Each infinite tree with at most one
infinite branch has an infinite branch (the weak König lemma with
uniqueness).
FIX!
:  Each uniformly continuous function from
a compact metric space into itself with at most one fixed point and
with approximate fixed points has a fixed point.
In, for example, the last of these, we say that a map \(f\) of a
metric space \((X,\varrho)\) into itself
has at most one fixed point
if \(\varrho(f(x),x) +
\varrho(f(y),y) \gt 0\) whenever \(\varrho(x,y) \gt 0\);
has approximate fixed points
if for each \(\varepsilon
\gt 0\) there exists \(x \in X\) such that \(\varrho(f(x),x) \lt
\varepsilon\).
A major open problem in CRM is that of finding a form of the fan
theorem that is equivalent, over BISH, to the
uniform continuity
theorem for
\([0,1]\),
UCT
\(_{[0,1]}\): Every pointwise continuous mapping of
\([0,1]\) into \(\bR\) is uniformly continuous,
the proposition for which Brouwer originally developed his proof of
the fan theorem. (Note that UCT\(_{[0,1]}\) is equivalent, relative to
BISH, to the general uniform continuity theorem for metric spaces:
Every pointwise continuous mapping of a complete, totally bounded
metric space into a metric space is uniformly continuous. See, for
example, Loeb [2005].)
It follows from results of Berger [2006] that
BISH \(\vdash\) UCT\(_{[0,1]}\Rightarrow\) FT\(_c\).
Also, Diener and Loeb (2008) have proved that
BISH \(\vdash\) FT\(_{\Pi^{0}_1} \Rightarrow\) UCT\(_{[0,1]}\).
However, we do not know if either of these implications can be
replaced by a bi-implication. Perhaps UCT\(_{[0,1]}\), and hence the
full uniform continuity theorem for compact metric spaces, is
equivalent, relative to BISH, to some natural, but as yet
unidentified, version of the fan theorem.
For additional material on the fan theorem in constructive reverse
mathematics, see, for example, Berger & Bridges [2007]; Diener
[2008, 2012]; Diener & Loeb [2009]; and Diener & Lubarsky
[2014]. In Dent [2013], there is a clear, though complex, diagram
illustrating the interconnections between fan theorems, continuity,
and omniscience principles (see Other Internet Resources).

mathematics in greater detail in the following supplementary

6. Constructive Algebra and Topology
Constructive mathematicians initially concentrated their efforts on
the field of analysis, with considerable success—witness the
wealth of functional analysis developed in Bishop [1967]. This does
not mean that, for example, algebra has been sidelined from the
constructive enterprise: the material in the monograph by Mines
et
al
[1986] can be regarded as a substantial algebraic counterpart
to the constructive analysis carried out by Bishop. Much more
recently, Lombardi and Quitté [2011] have published the first
large volume of a proposed two-volume work on constructive algebra.
However, not being expert in algebra, and being aware of the danger of
making this article too long to hold the reader’s attention, we
choose not to discuss constructive analysis or algebra in any detail;
rather, in the following supplementary document, we turn to
constructive topology, describing some rather different approaches to
that subject:
Approaches to Constructive Topology
7. Constructive Mathematical Economics and Finance
Investigations in constructive mathematical economics date back to a
series of papers on preference, utility, and demand from 1982 onwards;
see Bridges [1999]. In his doctoral thesis, Hendtlass [2013]
substantially weakened the conditions for the existence of a demand
function; he also produced a wealth of results in fixed-point theory
and its applications, in particular to constructivisations of two
classical proofs of the existence of an economic equilibrium.
In 2015, Berger and Svindland began a research project on constructive
mathematical finance, at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in
Munich.They first showed that the fundamental theorem on asset
pricing, the separating hyperplane theorem, and Markov’s
Principle are constructively equivalent (Berger & Svindland
[2016]). Their more recent work has concentrated on how to circumvent
the nonconstructivity of the classical extreme value theorem in order
to prove the existence of extreme points for functions in the presence
of even relatively weak convexity properties (Berger & Svindland
[2016a]). Their project suggests that mathematical finance, like
mathematical economics, may be a rich source of elegant, practical
constructive theorems.
8. Concluding Remarks
The traditional route taken by mathematicians wanting to analyse the
constructive content of mathematics is the one that follows classical
logic; in order to avoid decisions, such as whether or not a real
number equals 0, that cannot be made by a real computer, the
mathematician then has to keep within strict algorithmic boundaries
such as those formed by recursive function theory. In contrast, the
route taken by the constructive mathematician follows intuitionistic
logic, which automatically takes care of computationally inadmissible
decisions. This logic (together with an appropriate set- or
type-theoretic framework) suffices to keep the mathematics within
constructive boundaries. Thus the mathematician is free to work in the
natural style of an analyst, algebraist (e.g., Mines
et al.
[1988]), geometer, topologist (e.g., Bridges &
Vîță [2011], Sambin forthcoming), or other normal
mathematician, the only constraints being those imposed by
intuitionistic logic. As Bishop and others have shown, the traditional
belief promulgated by Hilbert and still widely held today, that
intuitionistic logic imposes such restrictions as to render the
development of serious mathematics impossible, is patently false:
large parts of deep modern mathematics can be, and have been, produced
by purely constructive methods. Moreover, the link between
constructive mathematics and programming holds great promise for the
future implementation and development of abstract mathematics on the
computer.
For further information about the state of modern constructive
mathematics, we recommend the forthcoming
Handbook of Constructive
Mathematics

Logics for Analyzing Games
First published Mon Mar 4, 2019; substantive revision Mon Dec 19, 2022
In light of logic’s historical roots in dialogue and
argumentation, games and logic are a natural fit. Argumentation is a
game-like activity that involves taking turns, saying the right things
at the right time, and, in competitive settings, has clear pay-offs in
terms of winning and losing. Pursuing this connection, specialized
logic games have already been used in the middle ages as a tool for
logic training (Hamblin 1970). The
modern area augmented this picture with formal dialogue games as
foundation for logic, relating winning strategies in argumentation to
cogent proofs (Kamlah 1973 [1984]).
Today, connections between logic and game theory span across a great
number of different strands, involving the interface with game theory,
but also linguistics, computer science, and further fields.

1. Overview
The present entry provides a comprehensive survey of logics for
analyzing games, arranged under a number of unifying themes and
perspectives. Also, occasional connections are made with other strands
at the interface of logic and games covered elsewhere in this
Encyclopedia. This overview section is a brief
tour
d’horizon
for topics that will return in more detail later
on.
1.1 Logic of Games
Specific games stand for significant recurrent patterns of social
interaction. In a perspective called ‘logic of games’,
notions and results from logic are used to analyze the structure of
various games. In fact, much classic reasoning about games involves
notions that are familiar from logic.
Example
Game solution reasoning.
Consider the following game tree for two players
A
,
E
,
with turns marked, and with pay-offs written with the value for
A
first. Alternatively, these values can be interpreted as
encoding players’ qualitative (or ordinal) preferences between
outcomes.
Figure 1.
ⓘ
Here is how players might reason. At her turn,
E
faces a
standard decision problem, with two available actions and the outcome
of action
left
better for her than that of
right
. So
she will choose left. Knowing this,
A
expects that his choosing
right
will give him outcome 0, while going
left
gives him outcome 1, so he chooses left. As a result, both players are
worse off than they would have been, had they played
right
/
right
. The reasoning in this scenario, in
short, leads to an outcome that is not Pareto-optimal.
The example raises the question just why players should act this way,
and whether, say, a more cooperative behavior could also be justified.
An answer obviously depends on the players’ information and
style of reasoning. Here it becomes of interest to probe the structure
of the example. Looking more closely, many notions are involved in the
above scenario: actions and their results, players knowledge about the
structure of the game, their preferences about its results, but also
how they believe the game will proceed. There are even counterfactual
conditionals in the background, such as
A
’s explaining
his choice afterwards by saying that “if I had played
right
,
E
would have played
left
”. These
notions, moreover, are entangled in subtle ways. For instance,
A
does not choose
left
because it dominates
right
in the standard sense of always being better for him,
but rather because
left
dominates
right
according to
his beliefs. How these beliefs are formed, in turn, depends on many
other features of the game, including the nature of the players.
In short, even a very simple game like the one discussed brings
together large parts of the agenda of philosophical logic in one very
concrete setting. This entry will zoom in on the aspects mentioned
here, with
Section 3
dedicated to players’ preferences and beliefs, while
Section 4
addresses reasoning styles and the dynamics of attitudes as the game
proceeds.
The analysis is structured by a few broad distinctions. Intuitively,
games involve several phases that involve logic in different ways:
deliberation prior to the game, as many game-theoretic solution
concepts are in fact deliberation procedures that create initial
expectations about how a game will go on. Observation and belief
revision during game play, including reactions to deviations from
prior expectations. And finally, post-game analysis, say, to settle
what can be learnt from a defeat, or to engage in spin about
one’s performance. Moreover all this can be considered in two
modes, assuming either a first-person participant or a third-person
observer view of games and play.
1.2 Logic and Game Theory
In many of the above topics, logics meets game theory. One such
interface area is
epistemic game theory
where game play and solution concepts are analyzed and justified in
light of various assumptions about players and their epistemic states,
such as common knowledge or common belief in rationality. Epistemic
game theory may be viewed as a joint offspring of logic and game
theory, a form of progeny which constitutes a reliable sign of success
of an interdisciplinary contact.
There are also other viable logical perspectives. In particular, one
can look at game theory the way mathematical logicians look at any
branch of mathematics. Following the style of the famous Erlangen
Program, one can discuss the structures studied in that field and look
for structural invariance relations and matching logical languages.
Game theory is rich in structure, as it has several different natural
notions of invariance. The tree format of extensive games offers a
detailed view of what happens step by step as players make their
moves, whereas the matrix format of strategic form games offers a
high-level view that centers on outcomes. Yet other formats, to be
discussed below, focus on players’ control over the various
outcomes. All these different levels of game structure come with their
own logical systems, as will be detailed in
Section 2
.
 Moreover, these different logics do not just provide isolated
snapshots: they can be related in a systematic manner.
In this way, the usual logical techniques can be brought to bear. For
instance, formal languages can express basic properties of games,
while model-checking techniques can determine efficiently whether
these hold in given concrete games (cf. Clarke,
Grumberg, & Peled 1999).
Example
Winning strategies.
Consider the following game tree, with move relations for both
players, and propositional letters \(\win_{i}\) marking winning
positions for player
i
.
Figure 2.
ⓘ
Clearly, player
E
has a winning strategy against player
A
, i.e., a recipe that guarantees her to win, no matter what
A
does. This is expressed by a modal formula capturing exactly
the right dynamics:
\[[\move_A]\langle \move_E\rangle \win_E\]
Here \([\move_A]\) is the universal modality “for all moves by
player
A
”, and \(\langle \move_E\rangle\) is the existential
modality “for some move by player
E
”. This two-step
modality- or quantifier-based response pattern is typical for
strategic powers of players in arbitrary games, as it captures the
essence of sequential interaction. Crucially, logical laws can acquire
game-theoretic import. For instance, the law of Excluded Middle
applied to the above formula yields:
\[{[\move_A]\langle \move_E\rangle \win_E} \lor {\neg[\move_A]\langle \move_E\rangle \win_E}\]
or in a logically equivalent formulation:
\[ {[\move_A]\langle \move_E\rangle \win_E} \lor {\langle \move_A\rangle [\move_E]\neg \win_E}\]
In two-step games like the above, where exactly one player wins (i.e.,
\(\win_A\leftrightarrow\neg\win_E\)), the latter formula expresses
that either player
E
or player
A
has a winning strategy.
More generally, this disjunctive assertion is a special case of
Zermelo’s theorem, stating that every finite full information
game is determined.
Having established the connection to logical languages, further
model-theoretic themes can be applied fruitfully to games. Language
based reasoning allows, for instance, to examine the preservation of
properties between different games, based on the exact syntactic shape
of their definition. Besides, logical syntax also supports logical
proof theory. Hence, the latter’s rich pool of proof calculi may
help to analyze basic results in game theory. This entry illustrates
major recurring patterns of reasoning about interaction that come to
light in this way.
Game theory also has a further natural level of representation,
suppressing details of local moves and choices. The most familiar
format for this are games in
strategic form
. In the simplest
case of only two players, these correspond to a two-dimensional
matrix, with rows standing for some player’s strategies, and
columns for the other’s. Individual cells of such matrix hence
correspond to the different possible
strategy profiles
of the
game. Typically, all cells are labeled with information about the
outcomes
resulting from playing the corresponding strategies
against one another. This labeling specifies players’ attitudes
to outcome in terms of pay-offs, more abstract utilities, or ordinal
markers for players’ preferences orders among outcomes.
Strategic form games, too, can model significant social scenarios.
Here is an illustration from the philosophical literature on the
evolution of social behavior.
Example
The following game in matrix form is the
Stag Hunt
of Skyrms (2003),
going back to ideas of David Hume. It serves as a metaphor for the
social contract.
E
H
S
A
H

Each agent must decide between pursuing their own little project,
hunting a hare, or joining in a larger collective endeavor, hunting
stag. The former gives a moderate but guaranteed income, no matter
what others do. The collective endeavor, on the other hand, can only
succeed if all contribute, in which case everybody receives a high
profit. If, however, some do not join, all contributions are lost and
no contributor receives anything. In the corresponding strategic form
game, all players have to decide on what to do in parallel, without
knowing the actions of others.
The Stag Hunt game has two pure strategy Nash equilibria:
every
contributes
, and
nobody contributes
. Which of these
stable outcomes ensues will crucially depend on the players’
reasoning, their expectations about each other, and perhaps even
further information stemming, for instance, from pre-game
communication.
Clearly, analyzing strategic games involves agentive information,
reasoning and expectations. All these aspects have tight connections
to logic. Viewing outcomes as possible worlds, three relevant
relations emerge between these. Within the matrix above, relating all
cells in the same row fixes a unique choice already made by the row
player
A
, while leaving
E
’s move completely open.
In short, each horizontal row lists all possible choices of the column
player
E
which
A
has to take into account. The
corresponding modality may hence be said to describe
A
’s
knowledge about the outcomes of the game given his choice. Still
assuming the row player’s perspective, relating cells vertically
rather than horizontally corresponds to
A
’s freedom of
choice among his available strategies. Of course, one could also
assume player
E
’s perspective instead, viewing the
horizontal direction as
E
’s freedom of movement, while
the vertical directions captures her epistemic uncertainty.
Thus, a bimodal logic arises for matrix games with laws such as
\[{K_{E}K_{A}\varphi} \leftrightarrow  {K_{A}K_{E}\varphi},\]
capturing the grid structure of matrix games. For more than two
players, this logic gains some additional options and subtleties to be
discussed in
Section 2.6
.
The crucial third relation is that of player’s preferences among
outcomes. These, again, have matching modalities, now taken from
preference logic (Hansson 2001). With
the help of some auxiliary devices, the three modalities can define
the central game-theoretic notion of a Nash equilibrium (Harrenstein
2004; van der Hoek & Pauly
2007).
Logics for matrix games differ from those for extensive games, as
grids behave quite differently from trees in terms of complexity. Yet,
both fall under the same general methodology. Towards a common
understanding, one might view the logic of matrix games as capturing
the basic laws of parallel, rather than sequential action.
1.3 Computation and Agency
Philosophical logic and mathematical logic are not the only
illuminating perspectives on games. A third relevant viewpoint is that
of computational logic. In modern computation, the paradigm is no
longer single Turing machines but interacting systems of multiple
processors. These processors may cooperate, but they might also
compete for resources. In general, hence, it is useful to study
multiple agents engaging in computation, be it within human,
artificial or mixed societies. Though doing so, games become a natural
model for computation, too. In fact, games are rich multi-agent
systems where agents process information, communicate, and engage in
actions, all driven by their respective preferences and goals. In the
converse direction, computer science themes such as complexity and
algorithmics have entered game theory, resulting in the area of 
computational game theory (Nisan et al.
2007). For a richer survey of computational logics of agency
and games, see van der Hoek and Pauly
(2007) and Shoham and Leyton-Brown
(2008). The present entry contains occasional links to
computation. These are especially prominent for reasoning about
temporally extended games and their strategies (Sections
4.2
,
4.4
) and in the context of gamification
 (
Section 6
),
 where games are explored as a novel semantics for classical logical
systems.
1.4 Games in Logic
Finally, recall the start of this section, but with reverse
perspective: instead of asking what logic can do for games, ask what
games can do for logic. Argumentation and dialogue are basic notions
for logic. Both can be studied using techniques and results from game
theory (Lorenzen & Lorenz 1978; Hamblin
1970). In this perspective, logical validity of consequence
rests on there being a winning strategy for a Proponent claiming the
conclusion against an Opponent granting the premises in a game where
moves are regulated by the logical constants. Many games have found
uses in modern logic since the 1950s, with
Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games for model comparison being a
paradigmatic example. Besides these, also semantic verification or
model construction can be cast as
natural logic games
.
This raises an intricate issue within in the philosophy of logic,
concerning the nature of logic and in particular that of logical
constants. A ‘weak thesis’ would hold that games
constitute a natural technique for analyzing logical notions, as well
as a didactic tool for teaching logic that appeals directly to vivid
intuitions. Parts of the literature, however, also defend a
‘strong thesis’, suggesting that the primary semantics of
certain logical systems may be procedural and game-theoretic, rather
than denotational in a standard sense. This perspective, sometimes
called ‘logic as games’, occurs in some attractive
semantics for first-order languages (Hintikka
& Sandu 1997), as well as in
game semantics for programming languages
.
The theme of logic as games will appear only briefly in the present
entry, which is mainly directed toward logics of games.
Section 6
will discuss which questions arise from joining both perspectives on
the interface of logic and games.
As it happens, the logic-as-games perspective is of broader relevance.
Logic games were originally designed for particular tasks inside
logic. Yet, taken to reality, they can help analyze or streamline
actual lines of argumentation. As such they may be compared to
designed parlor games that challenge reasoning skills. A game like
Clue
involves an intriguing mix of logical deduction, new
information from drawing cards or public observation of moves, but
also private communication acts by players (van
Ditmarsch 2000). Other parlor games, such as
Nine Men
Morris
(Gasser 1996) are graph
games (Grädel, Thomas, & Wilke
2002) with added chance moves that serve to diminish the risk
of finding a repeatable simple strategy on the fixed board. The
logical study of playable designed games for bounded agents, and the
design of new such games, is a natural sequel to this entry (cf.
van Benthem & Liu 2019).
1.5 Probability
Game theory may be understood as generalized interactive decision
theory. A major vehicle for the latter, just as for standard decision
theory, is probability theory. Within games, probability can assume
many roles. It may, for instance, express players’ degrees of
belief quantitatively, but it can also enrich the space of actions
with mixed strategies, thereby laying the ground for general
equilibrium results. Probability can even play a role in the very
definition of certain important games, especially in evolutionary game
theory (Osborne & Rubinstein 1994).
In this entry, probability is only mentioned in passing.
Section 5
,
 however, maps some combinations of logic and probability that are
suggested by the study of games.
1.6 Zooming In
Games have a natural interface with logic in all its varieties,
including mathematical, philosophical, and computational logic. In one
direction of contact, logic can provide new abstract notions
underneath game theory. Conversely, game-theoretic notions can also
serve to enrich logical analysis. The present entry mainly
concentrates on the first of these directions, the use of logic for
analyzing games. It does so mostly from a semantic perspective, the
dominant paradigm so far in the area. Though proof-theoretic
approaches will be mentioned occasionally. The sections to follow
elaborate on this theme along several dimensions. Specific
perspectives include logics for game structures
 (
Section 2
),
 logical analysis of the nature of players
 (
Section 3
)
 and of the process of game play
 (
Section 4
).
 Additional spotlights are put on the relationship between logic and
probability in the context of games
 (
Section 5
)
 and the endeavor of Gamification
 (
Section 6
).
 Each section forms a free-standing exposition, which results in some
unavoidable, and perhaps useful, overlap. Throughout the exposition,
some familiarity is assumed with the basic concepts of logic and game
theory. In particular, notions of game theory left unexplained here
can be found in the corresponding
entry
and in Leyton-Brown and Shoham
(2008).
2. Game Structure and Game Logics
This first spotlight section focuses on game structures in a narrow
sense.
Game forms
leave aside agents and notions typical for
these, such as preferences or information. Players, as well as the
temporal progression of play will be added in later sections. Even so,
there is already a good deal of structure in game forms to be studied
by logical techniques.
2.1 Levels of Representation
The starting point of any logical analysis is to fix its perspective
on games. This section will review several major candidates for doing
so, starting with the two most prominent perspectives. The first of
these makes the temporal structure of a game explicit, representing it
as a tree in the standard mathematical sense.
Example
A two-player extensive form game.
Figure 3.
ⓘ
A game in
extensive form
is a tree where each non-terminal
node or
state
specifies which player is to move next, while
edges correspond to the players’ possible moves. The leaves of
the tree, finally, denote the possible outcomes
O
of game play.
There are many possible variations on these stipulations for states
and moves, but they do not affect the essentials of a logical
analysis.
The second major perspective on games emphasizes the players’
available strategies. Suppressing all information about temporal
structure, a game in
strategic form
yields the matrix
pictures known from game theory. In its classic interpretation, a game
in strategic form represents a set of players that each select a
complete strategy for the entire game without knowledge of the other
players’ choices. Each strategy profile, i.e., combination of
one strategy per player, then induces an outcome \(O_i\). The
motivation for this structure might seem complex on first sight. Yet,
it can also be viewed as something quite simple: a one-step game with
parallel rather than sequential moves, which is the simplest case of
simultaneous action.
Example
A two-player strategic form game.
E
a
b
A
c
\(O_1\)
\(O_2\)
d
\(O_3\)
\(O_4\)
Extensive and strategic forms differ in their focus. The former
emphasize the sequential temporal structure of a game, while the
latter highlights strategy choice prior to play. One can freely switch
between both when appropriate to the purpose at hand. Besides these
two, there are other natural dimensions, highlighting players’
powers for influencing outcomes (cf.
Section 2.5
)
 or players’ information about the game (cf.
Section 3.6
).
Remark
While all examples so far concerned two-player
games, no such restriction is needed. Both extensive games and
strategic form games work for any number of players, although
occasional subtleties may occur. A few will be mentioned below.
Moreover, with more players, possible coalitions enter the picture, a
topic that will not be treated in this entry. Finally, selected
aspects of agency may sometimes enter through the back door. Many
scenarios in real life contain external chance events outside of any
player’s control, such as a roll of a die, weather conditions,
or technical malfunctions. Such factors can usually be incorporated
into a logical analysis by admitting Nature as additional player.
2.2 Invariance Relations Between Games
With different ways of representing a game at hand, there is a natural
follow up question concerning equivalence. Given two game structures,
when are they representations of the same underlying game? The answer
is that it very much depends on what aspects one is interested in.
Example
The same game, or not?
Figure 4.
ⓘ
Consider the two game forms above. If one cares about exact sequences
of moves or the choices players have along the way, these games are
different. The game to the left has
A
move first, while
E
begins in the game on the right. In the game on the right,
A
may face a choice between
p
and
q
. This cannot
happen on the left.
Caring about exact moves as done here constitutes a fine-grained
perspective on games. There are others. When focusing on
players’ powers for bringing about certain outcomes, for
instance, the analysis changes. In the game on the left,
A
has
a strategy (playing
left
) that ensures the game to end up in
an outcome satisfying
p
, and one (playing
right
) that
restricts possible outcomes to those satisfying \(q \lor r\). With
this second strategy, the further choice which of \(q or r\) gets
realized is left up to player
E
. Also the second player,
E
, has two strategies in the game on the left, one (playing
left
) ensuring the outcome to satisfy \(p\lor q\), the other
(playing
right
) guaranteeing that the outcome satisfies \(p
\lor r\).
Performing the same calculations for the game on the right, virtually
the same player powers emerge. More precisely,
A
’s
uniform strategies
left-left
and
right-right
yield
p
and \(q\lor r\) respectively, exactly the same powers as in
the left game. The two remaining strategies
left-right
and
right-left
yield \(p\lor q\) and \(p\lor r\), both of which
are mere weakenings of
A
’s power to achieve
p
.
Thus, at the level of players’ powers, the above two game forms
should be considered the same.
As this example illustrates, there are several legitimate ways of
comparing games. When taking a fine-grained focus on the internal
structure of a game, a natural candidate is the notion of a
bisimulation
(cf. Blackburn, de Rijke,
& Venema 2001). A bisimulation \(Z\subseteq G_1\times G_2\)
relates states of two game forms \(G_1\) and \(G_2\) subject to four
conditions: States
m
and
n
may only be related when
(
i
) the same player is to move in
m
and
n
,
(
ii
)
m
and
n
do not differ in any of their
basic local properties, while (
iii
a) whenever there is an
available move of type
a
in \(G_1\) leading to a state \(m'\),
there is a matching available move of type
a
in \(G_2\) leading
to a state \(n'\) with \(m'Zn'\), and vice versa (
iii
b)
whenever there is a move in \(G_2\) that leads to a state \(n'\),
there there is a move of the same type in \(G_1\) leading to a state
\(m'\) with \(m'Zn'\).
Example
A bisimulation between games.
Figure 5.
ⓘ
This particular notion of bisimulation is not the only invariance that
makes sense for games. A more coarse-grained perspective, for
instance, might not distinguish moves by their particular action
types, but merely by which player is to perform them. A corresponding
bisimulation can be defined by omitting references to particular
action types in conditions (
iii
a) and (
iii
b)
above.
Further notions of bisimulation take an even coarser perspective on
the games’ move structure, for instance by allowing to contract
zones where the same player moves several times in a row. Finally,
dropping all information about players and their choices, games can be
compared by the sequences of moves they admit. This purely
observational notion, known as
trace equivalence
in
computation, may, however, be less relevant in the context of games.
An alternative approach to coarsening focuses on the players’
powers to control outcomes, cf.
Section 2.5
and van Benthem, Bezhanishvili and Enqvist
(2019a).
While most notions of invariance discussed so far related to extensive
form games, a similar style of analysis applies to games in strategic
form. Van Benthem, Pacuit, and Roy
(2011) define modal bisimulations that connect outcome states
of different matrices, and apply bisimulation’s back-and-forth
conditions to the relevant relations of players’ choice,
freedom, and preference.
This may be a good point to stress once more that the present section
is concerned with game forms only, omitting any player related aspect
such as preferences between outcomes. When these are added,
identifying appropriate notions of invariance becomes more
challenging, as will be discussed in
Section 3
below.
2.3 Languages Matching Invariance Relations
The choice of invariance relations mirrors which structure is deemed
relevant within a given perspective on games. A central tool for
bringing out such relevant aspects is the existence of a logical
language matching some invariance relation. In general, the more
fine-grained the invariance perspective, the more distinctions a
matching language should be able to make.
For a start, if one is interested in the properties a player can bring
about through moves, a good choice of language is based on modalities
\(\langle \move_i\rangle \varphi\), expressing that at least one of
i
’s available moves leads to a next stage satisfying
\(\varphi\). The following illustrates how this language works in a
given extensive form game.
Example
Modal game language.
Figure 6.
ⓘ
The modal formula \([\move_A]\langle \move_E\rangle \win_E\), true at
root
r
, expresses that
E
has a strategy that ensures her
a win in two steps: whatever
A
does,
E
can react in such
a way that she ends up in a node where she wins. In a more
fine-grained perspective, the modal language could add expressions
\([a],[b]\ldots\) for specific move types \(a,b,\ldots\). In this
language, the coarse-grained modality \(\langle \move_i\rangle
\varphi\) is definable by the disjunction \(\bigvee_{a\text{ is a move
for }i}\langle a \rangle\varphi\), making the new language a
refinement of the old.
In this way, general results of modal logic apply to games. For
instance, take pointed models such as game trees with an indicator for
the current moment. Whenever two such pointed models \(\G,m\) and
\(\G',m'\) are bisimilar in the first sense defined above, the
equivalence \(\G, m\vDash\varphi\) iff \(\G', m'\vDash\varphi\) holds
for all formulas \(\varphi\) in a sufficiently rich modal language
with modalities \([a]\) for each move label. Thus, one can switch
between syntactic, language based perspectives and semantic invariance
relations, depending on what is convenient for a given perspective on
games. Entirely similar points hold for bisimulations and modal
languages for power perspectives, or for strategic form games.
Finally, modal languages do not have exclusive rights. If still more
fine-grained perspectives are needed, more expressive first-order or
higher-order languages become serious contenders for describing
games.
2.4 Modal Logic of Extensive Games
A language for games facilitates both, defining properties of games
and reasoning about them. An example are winning strategies for
players in a two-step extensive game as just discussed. More
generally, for any finite extensive game, there are formulas
\(\varphi_j\) for each agent
j
that are true iff
j
has a
winning strategy:
\[\varphi_j:=[\move_i]\langle \move_j\rangle[\move_i]\ldots \win_j\]
where the number of operators in the formula corresponds to the depth
of the tree.
Thus, logical laws governing reasoning with such formulas acquire
game-theoretic content. For instance, the negation of the statement
that one player,
A
, has a winning strategy is provably
equivalent to saying that the other player,
E
, has a winning
strategy, at least in those cases where
A
wins if and only if
E
does not:
\[\begin{aligned}
\neg \varphi_A &= \neg\langle \move_A\rangle [\move_E]\langle \move_E\rangle\ldots \win_A \\
& \leftrightarrow [\move_A]\langle \move_E\rangle[\move_E]\ldots \neg \win_A\\
& \leftrightarrow [\move_A]\langle \move_E\rangle[\move_E]\ldots \win_E=\varphi_E
\end{aligned}\]
Hence, the logical law of excluded middle in its modal guise
corresponds to Zermelo’s theorem, stating determinacy for finite
games.
Yet, there are limitations to such characterizations of game-theoretic
properties in terms of logical laws. Formulas stating whether some
player has a winning strategy change from model to model, as the
number of modal operators depends on the size of the game tree. In
fact, there is no uniform formula in the basic modal language
expressing that player
i
can win in an arbitrary finite
extensive form game. Such a formula can only be found in the modal
μ-calculus (Venema 2008), where the
statement that
i
has winning strategy can be expressed with the
fixed-point formula
\[\mu p. \, (\win_{i} \lor\, (\turn_i\land \langle i\rangle p)\lor\bigwedge_{j\neq i}(\turn_j\land\, [j]p)\]
The more general point here is that the recursive nature of
game-theoretic equilibria and solution concepts reflects naturally in
logics with fixed-point operators for induction and recursion.
In this setting, known results about modal logic acquire a new
significance. In the realm of finite models, for instance, having the
same modal formulas true at two states is
equivalent
to there
being a bisimulation connecting those two states (cf.
Blackburn, de Rijke, & Venema 2001).
Hence, whenever two finite games satisfy the same modal propositions
in their respective roots they are equivalent in the sense of
bisimulation. For infinite models, such results are less direct. A
full equivalence between bisimulation and satisfying the same
formulas, for instance, only holds for an extended modal language with
infinite conjunctions and disjunctions. Other relevant results include
the existence of modal formulas that define given pointed models up to
bisimulation. Such formulas sometimes exist in the basic modal
language, sometimes in the μ-calculus, and always in the infinitary
modal language. Applied to concrete games
G
, these modal
definitions can be viewed as complete descriptions of all properties
of
G
at the relevant level of invariance.
Finally, modal logic has many complete proof systems for capturing the
valid consequences on various classes of models (Blackburn,
de Rijke, & Venema 2001).
These calculi of reasoning also apply to games, where they can capture
aspects of specialized game-theoretic argumentation. Proof-theoretic
perspectives are not the focus of this entry, but a number of strands
will be mentioned where appropriate.
2.5 Modal Neighborhood Logic for Powers
Besides extensive form games, standard modal logic is also suitable
for the power perspective on game structure. Sometimes, one ignores
the internal mechanisms of a game altogether, merely viewing it as a
black box social mechanisms where players control outcomes to a
certain extent. In this perspective, a player can
force
the
outcome of the game to be in some set
X
if she commands a
strategy that ensures the game to end up in an outcome of
X
, no
matter what the other players do (van der Hoek
& Pauly 2007). Similarly, a player can force that some
proposition \(\varphi\) holds if she has the power to enforce that the
game ends in a \(\varphi\) state. The collection of all sets of
outcomes an agent can force are often called her
forcing
powers
. In classical game theory, these forcing powers sometimes
go by the name of
effectivity functions
(Peleg
1997), which are often also studied for
coalitions of players (see Pauly 2001; Goranko,
Jamroga, & Turrini 2013; and the entry on
logics for analyzing power in normal form games
).
Example
Powers in extensive games.
Figure 7.
ⓘ
Notably, forcing powers are not closed under conjunction. In the game
above, agent
A
can force
p
and
q
individually
without being able to force \(p \land q\). In modal logic terms,
forcing powers give rise to a
neighborhood logic
(Pacuit
2017), where the neighborhood
functions list the set of outcomes players can enforce from a given
state. Reasoning about forcing powers can then employ a logical
language with forcing modalities \(\{i\}\) for each player:
\(\{i\}\varphi\): agent
i
can force the outcome of the game to
satisfy \(\varphi\).
These modalities can be interpreted over the extended game forms with
neighborhood functions described above. On the semantic side, a
generalization of the above neighborhood models support a generalized
notion of
power bisimulation
, see van
Benthem, Pacuit, and Roy (2011).
The modal logic of powers allows to reason about games at a global
level of description. The modal logic of neighborhood models validates
the standard modal monotonicity principle
\[\{i\}\varphi\rightarrow\{i\}(\varphi\lor\psi),\]
as follows already from the truth definition of forcing modalities.
However, as forcing powers are not closed under intersection, the
aggregation law fails:
\[(\{i\}\varphi\land\{i\}\psi)\not\rightarrow\{i\}(\varphi\land\psi).\]
Instead, the logic contains new valid principles relating forcing
modalities for different players. For instance, if
i
can force
the truth of \(\varphi\), then no other player
j
can force its
falsity. Thus,
\[\{i\}\varphi\rightarrow\neg\{j\}\neg\varphi\]
is a valid principle of ‘consistency of powers’ in the
logic of forcing powers. The converse of this principle for games with
two players \(i, j\)
\[\neg\{j\}\neg\varphi \rightarrow \{i\}\varphi\]
expresses the notion of determinacy from the last section. This
formula is not generally valid, but is an axiom for the special class
of determined games.
Finally, there also is an alternative, more algebraic perspective on
powers, assuming an earlier-mentioned perspective of logic games. The
two games depicted in the core example of
Section 2.2
may be seen as evaluation games for propositional formulas
\[p \land  (q \lor r) \quad \text{and} \quad (p \land q) \lor (p \land r).\]
Their equivalence
qua
powers, described earlier, then matches
the standard propositional law of distribution. This algebraic
perspective will return in
Section 2.9
.
More recent views of forcing and powers re-interpret the sets
X
of outcomes employed in the above definitions as referring to both
players: one player restricts the total set of outcomes, while the
other players can achieve all outcomes within that set. This balance
between constraint and freedom significantly impacts the corresponding
notions of game equivalence, as well as the modal languages used (van
Benthem, Bezhanishvili, & Enqvist
2019b).
2.6 Modal Logic for Strategic Games
In the strategic perspective on games, players select actions
simultaneously, without having learned about their opponents’
choices of actions. This requires an additional level of analysis.
Besides the various possible moves, an adequate representation must
also track players’ uncertainty about how their opponents might
act.
In terms of matching logical languages, this suggest a
multi-modal
approach, with \([\approx_i]\) ranging over
i
’s possible choices, and \([\equiv_i]\) representing her
uncertainty about the opponents, see van
Benthem, Pacuit, and Roy (2011). Moreover, when considering
games rather than game forms, this picture needs to be enriched with a
third feature, viz. preference modalities \([\preceq_i]\), see
Section 3
.
Games in strategic form can be viewed naturally as models for a modal
language of choice and uncertainty, where each
state
m
consists of a strategy profiles, i.e., a sequence \((m_1,m_2\ldots)\)
listing each player’s choice of action. For convenience, the
preference modality has been included:
\(\G,m\vDash[\approx_i]\varphi\)
Given the opponents’ actions, \(\varphi\) holds whatever
i
does.
\(\G,m\vDash[\equiv_i]\varphi\)
Given
i
’s choice, \(\varphi\) holds whatever the
opponents do.
\(\G,m\vDash[\preceq_i]\varphi\)
\(\varphi\) holds in all states at least as good as the current
one.
This multi-modal language can express a variety of statements about
strategic form games, such as:
\({\langle\approx_i\rangle\langle\equiv_i\rangle} \varphi\)
\(\varphi\) is a possible outcome of the game
\({[\approx_i][\equiv_i]}\varphi\)
all outcomes of the game satisfy \(\varphi\)
\([\preceq_i]\langle\preceq_i\rangle\varphi\)
some optimal states for player
i
satisfy \(\varphi\)
In the case of two players, one agent’s choices corresponds to
the other’s uncertainty and vice versa. This shows in the
validity of principles such as
\[[\equiv_i]\varphi\leftrightarrow[\approx_j]\varphi\]
More generally, the logic of matrix games includes the \(\mathsf{S}5\)
axioms for both \([\approx_i]\) and \([\equiv_i]\), but also the
commutation law
\[[\approx_i] [\equiv_i]\varphi\leftrightarrow[\equiv_i][\approx_i]\varphi\]
expressing the grid-like structure of matrix games. This logic bears
some resemblance to STIT-type logics of actions (Herzig
& Lorini 2010). Technically, a
grid structure in models allows for encoding of undecidable
computational problems (Blackburn, de Rijke,
& Venema 2001), rendering it an open problem whether
expressive modal logics of game matrices are decidable.
The step from two to more players, often routine in epistemic logics,
can be delicate in the logic of matrix games. Accessibility relations
of type \([\approx_i]\), interpreted as identity of profiles except
for the \(i^{}\)-coordinate, yield a product logic akin to the
three-variable fragment of first-order logic which is known to be
undecidable (Bezhanishvili 2006).
However, with only relations of identity at the
i
-coordinate,
i.e., \([\equiv_i]\), the logic remains decidable (Venema
1998; Van De Putte, Tamminga, & Duijf
2017; Lomuscio, van der Meyden, & Ryan 2000).
2.7 Strategies as Logical Objects
There is further structure in extensive games than just single moves.
In game trees, a player’s
strategy
specifies what to do
at each turn, whether this turn will ever be reached or not. An
increasing body of work examines such strategies and their underlying
formats, see van Benthem, Ghosh, and Verbrugge
(2015) for an overview of various logical frameworks for
reasoning about strategies.
In one concrete perspective, a strategy is akin to a program that
instructs the agent on how to navigate a game tree. Hence, a natural
logic of strategies uses the language of
propositional dynamic logic of programs
PDL, an approach that will return later. As programs are in general
non-deterministic, such logics let a strategy recommend one or more
actions the agent should take at each turn. In this perspective,
strategies resemble plans that might remain partial.
In a program format, strategies start with basic actions, representing
individual moves in a game tree. From there, complex programs \(\pi\)
can be created using operations including sequential compositions
\(\pi_{1} \,;\pi_{2}\) (\(\pi_{1}\) is to be performed followed by
\(\pi_{2}\)), or choice \(\pi_{1}\, \cup_{i} \pi_{2}\) (agent
i
is to pick between actions \(\pi_{1}\) and \(\pi_{2}\) ). Moreover, a
test operation \(?\varphi\) for checking whether \(\varphi\) holds,
enables strategies to react to properties of states or
opponents’ past actions. Finally, to describe continuous
execution of a strategy along a game tree, it makes sense to have an
operation \(\pi^{*}\) of program iteration, stating that \(\pi\) be
executed arbitrarily often.
The language of PDL then has modal operators \([\pi]\) for every
program \(\pi\) that can be defined from the basic actions and the
operations just described. A simple such strategy advises player
i
to do
a
whenever it is her turn. The following formula
states that this strategy ensures that \(\varphi\) holds
throughout:
\[
[((?\turn_i \mathbin{;}  a)\, \cup \, (?\turn_j \mathbin{;} \move_j))^{*}]\varphi
\]
Program definitions for strategies given here are closely related to
the use of finite automata for defining strategies in computer science
and game theory (Osborne & Rubinstein 1994;
Grädel, Thomas, & Wilke 2002; Ramanujam & Simon
2008).
2.8 Simultaneous Moves and Imperfect Information
In the extensive form games of
Section 2.1
,
 players move in sequence and can base their decisions on full
information of what has happened so far. The other extreme were games
in strategic form, where agents move in parallel or, in the
interpretation of strategy selection, have no means of picking up
information during actual play. There are ample scenarios in between
these extremes. Public good games with optional retribution against
non-cooperators (Andrighetto et al.
2013), for instance, combine moments where some or all players
make simultaneous moves with information collection along the way.
Such parallel action can be mimicked in sequential games by limiting
the information available to players at various states of the game.
The resulting games of imperfect information will be discussed in
Section 3
,
 alongside other sources of imperfect information.
Further well-known logical approaches to parallel action employ STIT
logic (Horty & Belnap 1995; Broersen
2009), and temporal logics such as ATL (Alur,
Henzinger, & Kupferman 2002) or its
epistemic variant ATEL (van der Hoek &
Wooldridge 2003).
2.9 Game Algebra and Dynamic Logic of Computation
So far, games were treated as monolithic entities that agents reason
about in their entirety. This can be at odds with how real life agents
conceptualize games. To facilitate reasoning, games are often broken
up into smaller tasks that are easier to handle separately. A chess
player, for instance, may know how to solve different end games.
Rather than reasoning about every possible situation until its end,
she will evaluate different options in mid-play by considering which
of these end games they will, most likely, lead up to. In this
perspective, complex games are constructed out of simpler games that
may profit from separate analysis. Games then form an algebra with
operations that construct complex games from simpler ones. This style
of thinking is reinforced when games are viewed as scenarios for
interactive computation, where again algebraic methods are used widely
(Bergstra, Ponse, & Smolka
2001).
Here is an illustration of this approach. For simplicity, consider
only two players,
A
and
E
, the latter of which starts
the game. One influential game algebra has the following operations,
cf. Parikh (1985).
\(G\,\cup G'\)
Agent
E
has the choice between playing
G
and
\(G'\), i.e., represented by a choice node with two outcomes
G
and \(G'\)
\(G\,;G'\)
G
is played first, followed by \(G'\)
\((\cdot)^d\)
The roles of the players
A
and
E
are
interchanged
\(?\varphi\)
Test game whether some property \(\varphi\) holds.
For instance, take a chess player in mid-game reasoning. For
simplicity, restrict the possible end games to \(G_{F_1}\) and
\(G_{F_2}\). The player can then conceptualize mid-play as a game
\(G_{mid}\) with end nodes labeled by propositions \(p_1\) or \(p_2\),
describing which of the two end games follows. The full remaining
chess tree is then given by
\[G_{\textit{complete}}=G_{\textit{mid}};((?p_1;G_{F_1})\cup (?p_2;G_{F_2}))\]
Equational axiomatizations for this game algebra can be found in Goranko
(2003) and Venema
(2003). However, following the analogy
of propositional dynamic logic for an algebra of programs, there also
is a
dynamic game logic
for this algebra of games, (Parikh
1985). It adds a modality
\(\{G\}\varphi\) for each game
G
, with \(\{G\}\varphi\)
expressing that in game
G
, the first player
E
has a
strategy to force the truth of \(\varphi\). For the case of
non-determined games, the language will be extended further to include
separate modalities \(\{G, i\}\varphi\), one for each player
i
.
Dynamic game logic shows in a perspicuous manner how strategic
abilities for complex games supervene on abilities in simpler games.
This is done by means of reduction laws such as
\[\{G;G'\}\varphi\leftrightarrow \{G\}\{G'\}\varphi, \quad \{G\cup G'\}\varphi\leftrightarrow\{G\}\varphi\lor\{G'\}\varphi\]
For a complete list of reduction laws, as well as open problems in
this dynamic game logic see Pauly (2001), van
Benthem (2014). For other styles of game algebra, including
also forms of parallel composition, cf. Abramsky
(1997).
It should be said that imperfect information challenges this approach
to game algebra. For instance, one may have to decompose a larger game
into smaller subgames where agents need not know which of these
subgames they are in. Game algebras with imperfect information have
been studied in the context of Boolean Games (Harrenstein
et al. 2001). A recent
power-based game algebra with operations encoding imperfect
information, showing some analogies with IF logic (Mann,
Sandu, & Sevenster 2011) can be
found in van Benthem, Bezhanishvili, and
Enqvist (2019b).
2.10 Special Topics
Coalitions and Networks
Nothing has been said so far
about social or structural relations between players: they move
individually and in interaction with all other players. However, in
many games, groups of players can team up to jointly pursue goals,
possibly in competition with other groups. Coalitions are a natural,
but non-trivial extension of the logical frameworks introduced here,
as strategic abilities of groups may exceed those of all members
combined, see Peleg (1997), Van
de Putte & Klein (2021, 2022), and the
entry on
coalition powers in games
.
 In other studies of social phenomena, the set of players is equipped
with an additional network structure. An agents’ outcome or
behavior will then depend upon what network neighbors do (Baltag
et al. 2019; Christoff 2016). Lastly,
games on networks are closely related to information flows in social
networks, as studied in depth by Liu, Seligman,
and Girard (2014) and Seligman and
Thompson (2015) from a logical perspective.
Tracking
This section contains a wide variety of
perspectives on games. These differ in their invariance relations and
their matching languages, offering different foci such as outcomes,
powers, or the detailed temporal evolution of games. Even further
perspectives will no doubt keep emerging. This diversity may seem
overwhelming, making the field rather scattered. But here, another
role of logic shows, by not just proliferating systems, but also as
connecting them. Various logical translations exist between the
languages and levels involved. Often, reasoning about games in a logic
for some level can be mirrored precisely under translation into the
logic of another level. Moreover, these translations can often keep
track of changes in games under actions of information updates, a
topic to be taken up in Section 3. Tracking of this kind is defined
and studied in general logical terms in van
Benthem (2016) and Cinà
(2017), and in category-theoretic terms in Ye
(2022).
Infinite games
So far, games were tacitly assumed
finite in length. This assumption is innocuous for many real life
scenarios, yet there are notable exceptions. A prominent example are
safety games, where one of the players, the guard, has to ensure a
system to never leave a certain state, while the opponent attempts to
deviate. Many technical tools for finite games also work for infinite
games. There is, however, a number of conceptual and logical
discontinuities. Since infinite games have no last moments, for
instance, outcomes must be attached to complete histories of game
play, rather than leaves of a tree. Reasoning about games then
requires temporal modalities for a given history, but also modalities
ranging over all open future histories. For analyzing powers, then,
temporal versions of forcing modalities are needed. With these
modifications, a logical style of analysis still applies. For
instance, it is well-known that determinacy fails for infinite games
(Jech 2003). However, what holds for all
games is a law of ‘weak determinacy’ stating that, if
i
has no strategy to force a set of histories satisfying
\(\varphi\), her opponent
j
can ensure that
i
will never
obtain such a \(\varphi\)-strategy in the future. The difference
between standard determinacy and weak determinacy is captured by the
following two formulas, that are entirely in line with this
section’s style of analysis:
\(\{i\}\varphi\,\lor\,\{j\}\neg\varphi\) (determinacy) versus
\(\{i\}\varphi\lor\{j\}G\neg\{i\}\varphi\) (weak determinacy), where
G
is the temporal modality of ‘always in the future on
the current history’. A more radical use of infinite games is
found in coalgebra (Abramsky 1997; Jacobs 2016), where infinite
processes are modeled that can only be observed from the outside, but
not built up finitely from ground elements.
3. The Nature of Players
Game forms may be seen as spaces where players can operate. A game,
however, is not fully determined by its game form alone. Rather, the
players involved may import additional features relevant for game
play. Players can, for instance, be limited in their powers of
observation, either by aspects of the game structure or through
cognitive limitations. The most striking added feature, however, is
that players have preferences. Agents not only observe the world or
act in it. While these describe mere kinematics of a game, agents also
evaluate current state and various possible futures. Being driven by
preferences, it is such evaluations that are the moving force behind
player’s choices. Preference, hence, take a prominent
explanatory role for true game dynamics.
This section places its focus on the preferential and epistemic
dimensions of players. Such factors are essential to notions of
rationality where information, action, and preference are often
entangled. In game theory, a harmony between these is often sought in
notions of equilibrium for strategy profiles.
3.1 Preference and Equilibria
Game trees and game matrices specify the moves available to players at
different moments in time. They also indicate all possible outcomes,
either as cells in a matrix, or as leaf nodes in an extensive game.
However, to study what players
should
or
will
do in
a game, a further component is needed: players’ preferences.
Such preferences need not only reflect material pay-offs or other
features of outcome states. Rather, they may also relate to the
process of play itself, and which moves lead to a certain outcome.
Moreover, preferences may contain irreducibly subjective elements.
Even when assuming the same role in a game, different players may
disagree about the relative desirability of certain outcomes (Fehr
& Schmidt 1999).
Within a static, outcome-oriented perspective on games, a major
emphasis is on equilibria: strategy combinations where all players do
the best they can in light of their preferences and the
opponents’ strategies. A further, dynamic perspective focuses on
how such equilibria relate to the individual players’ stepwise
local reasoning on how to act in light of their beliefs and desires.
This perspective is taken up in
Section 4
.
3.2 Preference Logics for Games
For reasoning about preferences, it must first be specified what it is
that agents’ preferences apply to. The orthodox account lets
preferences exclusively range over possible outcomes (Osborne
& Rubinstein 1994). However, a
growing trend in the logical literature assumes agents to rather care
about the truth value of general propositions than can describe both
the progression or outcome of a game. While not equivalent, the two
perspectives are compatible. Both will be discussed in this
section.
In the classical picture, player
i
’s preferences on a
game tree are represented by a preference relation \(\prec_i\) ranging
over the set of outcomes. Such a relation is usually assumed
transitive and reflexive, but need not be total.
Example
A game tree with preferences.
Figure 8.
ⓘ
Just as with the earlier modal logics for game forms, a relatively
simple logical formalism can already express relevant aspects of
agency in games. It offers a low-complexity language for stating basic
features of action and information, without going into details of the
underlying quantitative mechanisms. More precisely, games with
preferences naturally support a logic with modal operators
\([\preceq_i]\) interpreted as:
\([\preceq_i]\varphi\)
\(\varphi\) holds in all states at least as good as the current
one to agent
i
.
Logics of this type can express various properties relevant to games.
They can, for instance, say that all states better than the current
one are \(\varphi\) states, making moving towards \(\varphi\) states a
necessary condition for maximizing utility. They can also express,
that all best states are \(\varphi\) states, with the formula
\[\langle\preceq_i\rangle[\preceq_i]\varphi\]
For more on modal preference logics, see 
Hansson (1990, 2001),Girard
(2008) and van der Torre
(1997).
Modal preference logic has further extensions with natural connections
to games. In a refined perspective, for instance, preferences may
derive from reasons, say, criteria or goals various agents want to
achieve. This gives rise to a duality between preference relations
among outcome states and priority orders over formulas, describing the
agents’ goals. Dynamic accounts, finally, track how preference
can change under various input events. For more on both of these
issues, see Liu (2011).
However, modal preference logics, construed either way, are not yet
rich enough to express one of the essential notions of game theory.
Further extensions are needed to deal with
best responses
,
expressing that the current move of a player is the best she can do in
light of her opponent’s actions.
Best response moves are the main ingredient for game equilibria.
Formally, a
Nash equilibrium
is a strategy profile, fixing a
unique choice for each player, where nobody can improve by
unilaterally changing strategy when all others maintain theirs. There
are several ways of defining this property in extended modal
preference languages. One possibility is to simply introduce a new
atom \(b_i\), stating that the current world is the best player
i
could have achieved in light of the opponents’ actions.
In this language, Nash equilibrium are characterized by
\[\bigwedge_{i\in \text{Players}}b_i.\]
More explicit definitions exist, building on the strict preference
modalities of van Benthem, Girard, and Roy
(2009). Yet, perhaps the simplest illuminating approach uses an
intersection modality
from hybrid logic (Areces
and ten Cate 2007) combining the
agent’s preference relation with her uncertainty between the
opponent’s action to characterize best responses and Nash
equilibria (cf.
Section 2.6
):
\[\bigwedge_{i\in \text{Players}}[\prec_i\cap\equiv_i]\bot\]
Expressing Nash equilibrium has served as a benchmark for logics of
strategic games (van der Hoek & Pauly
2007). Yet there are other desiderata, often connected to
analyzing standard game-theoretic solution concepts for games. These
are usually designed to find Nash equilibria or at least narrow down
the strategy profiles to those compatible with certain requirements of
rationality. Well-known methods of this kind are Backward Induction
for extensive games and Iterated Removal of Strictly Dominated
Strategies for strategic form games (Osborne
& Rubinstein 1994). These will be discussed now, as they
raise intriguing further logical issues.
3.3 Backward Induction in Extensive Form Games
Here is a high-level description of Backward Induction. In extensive
game forms, the aim is to introduce a new preference-based relation
\(\best_i\), denoting that some move is the best a player can do at
some given state. Thus, \(\best_i\) is a subset of player
i
’s total move relation, to be defined in a suitable
manner.
For final moves, standard decision theory suggests that a choice is
best for the active player if no other move leads to a better outcome.
When extending the analysis to earlier positions of the game, things
depend crucially on players’ expectations about their
opponents’ future behavior. Several possible policies exist,
depending on the types of player involved. A widespread assumption in
epistemic game theory is common belief in rationality, i.e., that all
players involved are rational, believe their opponents to be rational,
believe their opponents to believe that opponents are rational, and so
on. In line with this assumption, the following algorithm extends the
\(\best_i\) relation recursively to non-terminal nodes:
Whenever player
i
is to move at state
s
, possible
choices are assessed by comparing what would happen if, after that
move, everybody followed their \(\best\) relation. A possible move at
s
is included in
i
’s \(\best\) relation if the
best outcome of this move followed by repeated \(\best\) moves by all
players is at least as good as every other move
i
could make at
s
, followed by \(\best\) moves by all players.
Here is how this bottom-up procedure works in practice.
Example
Backward Induction.
Figure 9.
ⓘ
This procedure is a qualitative version of classic game theory’s
Backward Induction, which is based on utility values rather than
preference relations (Leyton-Brown & Shoham
2008).
Backward Induction and the resulting \(\best\) relation is a prime
example for the complex entanglement of preferences, information and
action. A key modal axiom governing this relation was identified by
van Benthem, van Otterloo, and Roy
(2006). \(\best^*\) denotes here the transitive closure of the
union of all \(\best_i\) relations.
\[
(\turn_i\land\langle \best\rangle[ \best^*](\operatorname{end}\rightarrow p))\rightarrow[\move_i]\langle  \best^*\rangle(\operatorname{end}\land\langle \preceq_i\rangle p)
\]
Describing the limit of a dynamic process with a static property, this
equivalence exemplifies a family of
characterization theorems
that play a crucial role within the logical analysis of games. Other
dynamic perspectives can be analyzed in a similar logical style (Liu
2011).
3.4 Iterated Removal of Dominated Strategies
Iterative reasoning strategies akin to Backward Induction also exist
for games in strategic form. Rather than defining a new unary
move-predicate \(\best\), however, these procedures work by
eliminating suboptimal actions. An action
a
is labeled
suboptimal or
dominated
if there is some other available
action,
b
, that guarantees a better result than
a
, no
matter what the opponents do. In this case a rational player should
drop
a
from her space of admissible acts, as she would never
play it.
Just as Backward Induction, dominance reasoning has an iterative
flavor. Assuming common belief of rationality, players can expect
their opponents to also drop dominated actions from consideration.
Doing so reduces the game and might render further moves dominated, as
is illustrated in the following example. Within the left-to-right
temporal progression, moves are greyed out as they get discarded.
Players’ preferences are represented with numerical values with
1 the best and 4 the worst.

The fact that further strategies may become dominated suggests to
repeat the procedure, turning removal of dominated strategies into an
iterated process. When games are finite, this process is guaranteed to
converge in finite time. Iterated removal of dominated strategies on
binary preference relations is a qualitative variant of the version
employed in classical game theory, where cardinal utility values are
assumed (Leyton-Brown & Shoham
2008).
A closely related process is iterated removal of
weakly
dominated
strategies, where some move
a
is deleted if
there exists a
b
that outperforms
a
on some of the
opponents’ moves, while being at least as good on the remaining
ones. Unlike its strict counterpart, iterated removal of weakly
dominated strategies suffers from a number of technical and conceptual
intricacies, such as order dependence of iterated deletion (Samuelson
1992; Pacuit & Roy 2011).
3.5 Goals
Generalizing the concept of winning or losing, agents can be assigned
goals they pursue in a game. Restricting to a single goal per agent
retains a binary perspective: A goal is reached or not. Goals,
however, allow for additional flexibility. Besides pure competition as
in win-lose games, these can also express pure coordination games,
with everybody pursuing the same goal, or mixed motive games with
partial overlap between different players’ goals.
The concept of goal functions is particularly prominent in the logical
framework of
Boolean games
(Harrenstein 2004). There, each agent
is given control over some atomic propositions, permitting her to
freely decide on their truth value. Goals are then formulated as
propositional formulas over the set of all players’ atoms.
Crucially, a player’s goal formula might hence involve atoms
that are not under her control. In iterated extensive Boolean games,
goal formulas might also refer to properties of histories of play
defined in temporal logics (Gutierrez,
Harrenstein, & Wooldridge 2015)
3.6 Knowledge, Belief, and Limits of Information
There are various types of information players can possess or lack
about a game. First and foremost, players can be uncertain about the
types of opponents they face: their preferences, their reasoning about
the game and how they expect the game to unfold. Second, agents’
uncertainty can extend to the game itself. Players, of course’
won’t know their opponents choices in a simultaneous move game.
Besides, agents might also have limited information about past moves
and events. Such uncertainty can arise from the game structure
eschewing certain observations, but also from failing to record past
information properly. In yet more extreme cases, agents might even be
unsure about the moves available to their opponents.
Given the various limitations to their knowledge, players may
entertain beliefs to structure their uncertainty. Such beliefs may,
naturally, change over time, as players communicate or observe the
game unfold. The importance of beliefs in the logical analysis of
games has been emphasized in Stalnaker
(1998), who was the first to highlight the role of belief
revision in analyzing reasoning about game solution.
3.6.1 Uncertainty about moves
In one sense of uncertainty, even highly idealized agents might have
but limited information of what has happened so far. In certain cases,
the game’s structure may limit some players’ observational
powers of their opponents’ moves. In other instances, agents may
suffer under cognitive limitations restricting their perspective on
the game. Or, sometimes, agents might simply fail to record some of
the moves made by themselves or others.
Within
extensive games with imperfect information
, all such
cases are represented by indistinguishability relations
\(-\,-\,-\,-_A\) between states \(m,m'\), expressing that agent
A
cannot distinguish between being at
m
and \(m'\).
Notably, this does not preclude the player from learning later on in
the game whether he has been at
m
or \(m'\).
Example
A game with imperfect information.
Figure 10.
ⓘ
While allowing agents to lack information of various kinds, the above
analysis makes one structural assumption about players: they always
know which moves are available to them at a given node. In extensive
games with imperfect information, this translates to the requirement
that whenever two states are indistinguishable to some agent, they
coincide on the set of her possible actions.
The move from perfect to imperfect information has major implications
for strategic reasoning. In the game depicted above, player
A
cannot distinguish between being at
m
and \(m'\). When at the
former, she may, for all she knows, be at \(m'\) instead. Hence
A
’s decision needs to account for both possibilities; she
cannot base her choice on any property that holds at only of those
locations. In particular,
A
has no available strategy that
guarantees her ending up in a \(\win_A\) node. Since
E
cannot
ensure a win either, no player has a winning strategy. This is a
central difference with finite perfect information games, where it is
guaranteed that one of the players has a winning strategy, cf.
Section 2.4
.
3.6.2 The logic of imperfect information
Reasoning about imperfect information requires to extended languages
for extensive form games with epistemic modalities. For each player
i
, modality \(K_i\varphi\) represents
i
’s
knowledge. The usual semantics of epistemic logic relates this to
uncertainty, as encoded by the players’s indistinguishability
relation:
\(\mathcal{M},m\vDash K_i\varphi\quad\) all states \(m' \text{ with }
m\,-\,-\,-\,-_i\,m'\) satisfy \(\mathcal{M},m'\vDash\varphi\)
This language is best illustrated with the above game tree. To this
end, interpret the tree as the classic children’s game where one
player,
A
, has to guess in which hand her opponent,
E
,
hides some little token. Once
E
has hidden the token in, say,
her right hand (move \(h_R\)), the guessing player has a winning move
de re
: she should pick
right
(\(p_R\)). However, as
the token was placed in secret, she may not know that picking
right
is a winning move: the player has no winning strategy
de dicto
. This is expressed by:
\[\mathcal{M},m\vDash [p_R]\win_A\land\neg K_A[p_R] \win_A.\]
In a game theoretic setting, the
de re
vs.
de dicto
distinction has been studied by Horty and
Pacuit (2017) and van Benthem
(2001).
In light of these considerations, many logics for defining strategies
involve epistemic elements. It seems reasonable to demand that agents
cannot base their choice of strategy on everything that has happened
before, but only on what they know, i.e., their current information
(Pacuit, Parikh, & Cogan 2006). The
resulting
uniform strategies
(Maubert
2014), can be defined by the knowledge programs of Fagin,
Halpern et al. (1997). Further
restrictions are possible, for instance granting agents limited memory
that only reaches back a fixed number of moves (Gutierrez,
Harrenstein, & Wooldridge
2015).
The epistemic action language can express many further phenomena in
imperfect information games. The following game is an
illustration.
Figure 11.
ⓘ
Once player
E
arrives at node
n
, she cannot discern that
actual situation from node \(n'\). However,
E
must have
possessed information earlier on that distinguishes
n
from
\(n'\): to arrive at
n
, she must have played
a
as her
first choice, while \(n'\) can only be reached after playing
b
.
Thus,
E
can only be uncertain between these two nodes if she
forgot about her own previous actions.
The epistemic action language can distinguish between such scenarios
with memory loss and those without. The property of
Perfect
Recall
states that players retain full memory of all moves they
observed. This can be expressed by the following axiom scheme (Halpern
& Vardi 1986; Bonanno 2004)
\[K_i[a]\varphi\rightarrow[a]K_i\varphi.\]
Also the converse of this scheme admits a natural interpretation:
\[[a]K_i\varphi\rightarrow K_i[a]\varphi.\]
This
No Miracles
property expresses that players can only
learn by observing moves, not by any other methods extraneous to the
game.
Of course, logic does not presuppose that all players have perfect
memory, or that they cannot pick up any information outside the
progression of play. Epistemic action language can equally well be
employed to analyze more general scenarios where the above axioms do
not hold. Especially within dynamic-epistemic versions, epistemic
logics can produce modified versions that cover many more cases than
those described here (van Benthem 2014).
Moreover, further modalities from epistemic logic make sense, in
particular, those for common or distributed knowledge in groups of
players (Fagin, Halpern et al. 1995; Meyer
& van der Hoek 1995).
An epistemic component with operators \(K_i\) fits with many logical
perspectives on games. In particular, epistemic extensions are as
compatible with coarse logics such as the earlier-mentioned
\([\move_i]\)-setting with a single move-modality per player, as with
fine logics where each individual action type is represent by a
distinct modality \([a]\). In fact, in
Section 2.6
,
 epistemic operators were used for analyzing games in strategic form,
where modalities naturally relate to uncertainty about the other
players’ strategies.
3.6.3 Uncertainty about options and preferences
In more general settings, uncertainty does not stop at the
opponents’ informational states. In international relations or
economic bargaining, also the players’ motivations and
preferences are not fully known to all parties involved. Within the
corresponding extended form games, players may be uncertain about
their opponents’ preferences and strategic options, whether they
can afford a certain move or whether they actually possess the
information they threatened to reveal. Obviously, uncertainty about
preferences or available options will impact reasoning about the
equilibria of a game. Strategic players might even try to exploit such
uncertainties, for instance by pretending to have options they do not
possess.
In a first pass, this type of uncertainty can be expressed by
introducing nature as hypothetical player, with a first move that
determines the preferences and available options for all players. A
simple example is the game depicted below. At the start,
A
is
uncertain whether
E
can reply to
A
’s move
f
by playing
e
. Likewise, she lacks information on whether
E
prefers \(O_3\) over \(O_4\), or vice versa.
Figure 12.
ⓘ
From a logical point of view, this miraculous initial move by Nature
is not needed. Standard epistemic models can represent the above
scenario, and many more complex ones, by means of the
indistinguishability relations introduced above. Technically, this
requires to move beyond standard imperfect information trees to
so-called
epistemic forests
(van
Benthem, Gerbrandy, Hoshi, & Pacuit 2009), sets of trees
linked by epistemic relations. In particular, the above game tree
transforms into
Figure 13.
ⓘ
The epistemic action language for trees works just as well on
epistemic forests. However, in suitably expressive languages, the
logic of forests is weaker than that of trees, as the set of
validities on the class of
n
-player trees is a strict superset
of the validities on
n
-player forests.
3.6.4 Imperfect information and beliefs
Further enrichments of the logical framework add semantic structure to
the agents’ uncertainty. When unable to determine the exact
situation, players may classify options with respect to plausibility.
To this end, epistemic models have been equipped with plausibility
orderings \(\geq_i\) for players
i
(Boutilier
1994; Stalnaker 1968; Baltag & Smets
2008).
In the preceding example, plausibility order might work as
follows:
Figure 14.
ⓘ
This richer structure is reflected by introducing new modalities for
agents’ beliefs, determined by the most plausible states:
\(\mathcal{M},w\vDash B_i^{\phantom{\psi}}\varphi\quad\) \(\varphi\)
holds in all \(\geq_i\)-maximal states in
i
’s epistemic
range.
Conditional belief, important to players’ planning within a
game, can be interpreted in the same style:
\(\mathcal{M},w\vDash B_i^\psi\varphi\quad\) \(\varphi\) holds in all
\(\geq_i\)-maximal \(\psi\)-states in
i
’s epistemic
range.
These clauses are intended to work in finite as well as in infinite
settings. However, in the latter case minor modifications might be
needed akin to those in
conditional logic
.
 These have been proposed in various alternatives. Notably, this
enriched epistemic-doxastic logic allows for further, less standard
interpretations beyond those illustrated so far. Examples are
‘strong belief’, expressing that all relevant
\(\varphi\)-states are more plausible than all relevant
\(\neg\varphi\) states, or ‘safe belief’ saying that
\(\varphi\) holds at all states that are at least as plausible as the
current one. See van Benthem and Smets
(2015) for an overview of plausibility semantics and its
connections to conditional logic, belief revision theory,
dynamic-epistemic logic, and a wide range of philosophical and
technical issues.
3.7 Higher Order Uncertainty and Type Spaces
In various scenarios, agents reason not only about the
opponents’ preferences or admissible moves, but also about their
beliefs about the game and others’ behavior therein. In fact,
such higher-order reasoning can have a major impact on game play. A
prime example is the Backward Induction procedure of
Section 3.3
,
 where the construction of a best move relation crucially relied on
common knowledge of rationality. More generally, agent’s best
moves frequently depend upon what they expect others to do. This
phenomenon is especially prominent for simultaneous move games, where
it occurs in both coordinative scenarios (Skyrms
2003; Lewis 2002) as well as
competitive ones (Hotelling 1929). More
details can be found in the entry on
epistemic game theory
.
Arbitrary first and higher order levels of knowledge and belief can be
represented with the above relational models, the standard tool in
epistemic
and doxastic logic. For information in extensive form games, the
epistemic-doxastic perspective on states can be combined with
\(\move\)-relations in exactly the way described before. The result
are
epistemic-doxastic trees
or
forests
that can
represent most types of knowledge or belief players might have about
the game, including its exact shape, previous moves, opponents’
preferences or opponents’ first- and higher-order beliefs on any
of these matters.
Outside of logic, higher-order information has also been modeled in
classical game theory. Quantitative frameworks represent information
as probability distributions over a given event space. In this
setting, higher-order information corresponds to probability
distributions over probability distributions of the right kind. More
specifically, \(n^{\textrm{th}}\) order information corresponds to a
probability distribution over the space of \((n-1)^{\textrm{th}}\)
order beliefs. As shown by Harsanyi
(1967–1968), the limit of specifying higher and higher
levels of information can be represented as a type space, where each
agents’ type is a probability distribution over states of nature
and the other players’ types. In an abstract sense to be
discussed below, these types correspond to states in standard models
of modal logic.
In addition to standard modal models, logic also has a straightforward
analogue to probabilistic type spaces:
logical type spaces.
In a formal framework first introduced by Fagin,
Geanakoplos et al. (1999), an
n
-type is a sequence \(\mathfrak{f}_n=\langle
f_0,f_1\ldots,f_{n}\rangle\) where \(f_0\) specifies the state of
nature, i.e., a valuation recording which atomic propositions are true
or false, and \(f_1\) lists for all players the states of nature they
consider possible. \(f_m\) for \(m\geq 0\) then specifies for all
players which \((m-1)\)-types, i.e., sequences \(\langle
g_0,\ldots,g_{m-1}\rangle\) they consider possible. In this way, an
n
-type fixes the player’s higher-order beliefs up to
level
n
. These types are, of course, subject to coherence
conditions: the agents’
k
-types for different
k
must fit together. For instance, whenever some agent considers a
k
-type \(\mathfrak{f}_k\) possible, she must also consider any
initial segment \(\mathfrak{f}_{k'}\) for \(k'<k\) possible.
Conversely, any \(k'\) type the agent considers must be the initial
segment of
some
k
type the agent holds possible. Type
spaces offer a semantics for the epistemic language: Inductively, for
a formula \(\varphi\) of modal depth
m
, \(K_i\varphi\) is true
at a type \(\mathfrak{f}_n\) if all \(g_{m}\in f_{m+1}(i)\) satisfy
\(\varphi\) or if \(m>n\).
Alternatively, the set of
n
-types allows for a natural
interpretation as relational models with accessibility relations
defined by
\(\langle f_0,\ldots f_n\rangle R_i\langle g_0,\ldots
g_n\rangle\quad\) For all \(m\leq n\) holds \(g_{m-1}\in f_m(i)\)
Interpreting the set of
n
-types as a relational model yields a
second way of evaluating the epistemic language on logical type
spaces. For formulas of modal depth less than
n
the two
interpretations coincide. Hence, up to finite depths, type spaces and
their associated relational models are two perspectives on the same
informational situation.
To fix all of the agents’ beliefs, the analysis moves to types
\(\mathfrak{f}=\langle f_0,f_1,\ldots\rangle\), containing some
\(f_n\) for every natural number
n
. In this extended framework
the situation becomes more complicated. The space of all such types is
universal in the following sense: every relational model can be mapped
in a truth-preserving manner to the space of all types by sending each
state to a full description of the agents’ corresponding first-
and higher-order informational attitudes. This map, however, is
usually not a modal bisimulation. In fact, the process of type
construction could be continued indefinitely, yielding a transfinite
hierarchy of mutually non-bisimilar type spaces (Heifetz
& Samet 1998). Such transfinite
types can become relevant when the epistemic language is enriched with
modalities for common group knowledge, in which case a full
description of all expressible attitudes involves infinite hierarchies
of higher-order information (Fagin, Geanakoplos
et al. 1999). A recent logical study of type spaces including
their probabilistic structure can be found in Bjorndahl
and Halpern (2017).
The tight connection between type spaces and relational models is
compatible with additional assumptions that might be imposed on the
players’ mental states. Fagin,
Geanakoplos et al. (1999) characterizes when type spaces give
rise to \(S5\) models, while Galeazzi &
Lorini (2016) do the same for multi-agent
KD45
belief.
While relational models and logical type spaces represent exactly the
same information, their main differences is in perspective. Relational
models take a third person bird’s eye view on possible worlds.
Their starting point is a set of worlds rich enough to contain all
states considered possible by the relevant agents, together with
accessibility relations modeling players’ information. From
there, agents’ first-order beliefs at the various worlds can be
read off and, subsequently, also all higher levels of information.
Logical type spaces
, by contrast, assume a first person
perspective. They take a full description of first and higher-order
beliefs as primitive and treat indistinguishability as a derived
relation.
Finally, it should be noted that type spaces assume a static
perspective on games. No provisions are taken for representing moves
or strategies explicitly, nor for incorporating updates of knowledge
and belief that occur as a game in extensive form unfolds, cf. the
discussion in
Section 4
.
 Thus, there is some distance between type spaces and the earlier
epistemic-doxastic forest models for extensive games. As a first step
towards filling this gap, it has been shown how type spaces can
accommodate product updates from dynamic epistemic logic (Klein
& Pacuit 2014).
3.8 Reasoning, Bounded Agency, and Player Types
Besides variations in preferences and beliefs, a third crucial aspect
of players is their styles of information processing, decision making,
and reasoning. Real cognitive agents are bounded in their information
processing, as both their memory and reasoning capacities are limited.
In particular, players may not be able to represent the entire game
they are in, nor reason until the end of the game. This phenomenon of
short sight
has been studied in Grossi
and Turrini (2012) and Turrini
(2016). Moreover, in real-life iterated social interaction,
payoffs are generated along the game, and may not be clear beforehand,
(Axelrod & Hamilton 1981). In such
contexts, the best strategy in terms of short-term payoffs need not be
optimal in the long run, but bounded agents may miss this longer
horizon, (Klein, Marx, & Scheller
2021).
Logical literature on bounded agency is too broad to be surveyed here.
For a few research lines relevant to games, see Fagin
and Halpern (1987) and Heifetz, Meier, and
Schipper (2006) on epistemic logics with awareness, Artemov
(2008) on
justification logics
,
 van Benthem and Pacuit (2011) on
evidence logics, and Hansson (1998) and Lorini
(2018) on doxastic logics with computationally tractable belief
bases.
In the game theoretic literature, bounded agents have often been
represented as finite state machines (Gutierrez,
Harrenstein, & Wooldridge 2015;
Binmore & Samuelson 1992). Limitations on reasoning
capacities or memory size then translate into bounds on the machine
size. The resulting hierarchy allows for a fine grained analysis of
information processing, reasoning, and thus bounded players of
different types. This perspective fits well with the logical study of
agency in computer science, (Grädel,
Thomas, & Wilke 2002; Wooldridge 2009).
In an integrated perspective, preferences, beliefs and reasoning
styles can all be subsumed under the game-theoretic notion of a
player type
. For reasoning about the future course of a game,
players will hence often entertain beliefs about each others’
types. A simple example is Backward Induction, where players assume
all opponents fully rational throughout. In more complex settings,
individual actors may attempt to rationalize various moves observed
and derive predictions about their opponents’ future behavior by
taking a broader range of options into account. Such players may start
by assuming the counter-player to be a simple machine, and only move
up to more complex views when required by evidence. In particular,
there is no reason to assume uniformity of players or views. Within a
given scenario, a diversity of player types might be present (Liu
2009; Liu & Wang 2013; Paul & Ramanujam
2011; Ghosh & Verbrugge 2018; Bergwerff et al. 2014). For
some game-theoretic proposals concerning most frequently occurring
player types, see Camerer (2003).
3.9 Thin and Thick Models for Players
This section has outlined a variety of ways for incorporating players
and agency into game forms. These come in a hierarchy of richness,
ranging from annotated game trees to epistemic forests, type spaces,
or yet more abstract models of games.
At the thinner end, the focus is on structural aspects of the game,
incorporating players’ preferences, but not necessarily their
beliefs. Such frameworks are typically just rich enough to represent
equilibria or backward induction paths, and to reason about these in
logics of action and preference. Thin models leave much information
about players’ knowledge, beliefs, or their
modus
operandi
unspecified, and put less emphasis on the actual
dynamics of game play.
At the thicker end, models for games have lush worlds encoding
players’ preferences, information, beliefs, and perhaps even
their complete types, including memory and reasoning capacities.
Typical models of this kind are found in Stalnaker
(1998) and Halpern
(2001). When applied to extensive
games rather than strategic-form games, thick models can anticipate
anything that can happen in one large temporal universe, allowing to
derive a full prediction about how play will proceed.
The distinction between thick and thin logical models seems folklore
in applied logic. In fact, it occurred already in the
earlier-mentioned choice between local logics with single step
modalities versus temporal logics built over a complete universe of
histories. Yet, there does not seem to be a unique best perspective.
Rather, the choice between thick and thin models often depends on the
exact goals pursued. A central consideration in this trade off is
where the dynamics of stepwise play should be located: Thick models
pre-encoded such dynamics, whereas thin models allow for an external
dynamic logics for updates (Baltag, Smets, and
Zvesper 2009). The next section will highlight a number of ways
for complementing a thin perspective with dynamic information on game
play through representations of actions and updates.
3.10 Special Topics
Deontic reasoning
Preference is closely related to
obligation and permission. This shows in particular on the formal
side, where preference logic in both static and dynamic variants (Hansson
1990; van Benthem, Grossi, & Liu
2014) has clear analogies with
deontic logic
.
 Moreover, deontic and game-theoretic perspectives have given rise to
many fruitful connections. In one direction, deontic notions may be
seen as high-level descriptions of optimal actions given the
information and obligations of agents (Kooi
& Tamminga 2008; Anglberger, Gratzl, & Roy 2015).
Conversely, an agent’s goals and intentions may be derived from their
obligations (Klein & Marra 2020).
More generally, game solution procedures can enrich accounts of
deontic notions (Başkent, Loohuis and
Parikh 2012; Horty 2018). The connection between games and
deontic reasoning may also highlight new topics, for instance on the
relation between individual and collective preferences (Duijf,
Tamminga & Van De Putte 2021).
Lastly, in artificial intelligence, deontic perspectives arise in
tracking the behavior of a distributed system in relation to its
goals, (Ågotnes & Wooldridge
2010).
Mathematical foundations
Incorporating players raises
new questions about game equivalence. When agency matters, adequate
notions of equivalence cannot stop at preserving properties of the
underlying game form. Rather,
player-dependent equivalences
will also require preservation of players’ beliefs, preferences
or reasoning types. Incorporating such additional parameters makes it
harder for two games to be equivalent, as new space for variation
comes into play. On the other hand, agent limitations might also
create new simpler game equivalences that can be studied by the tools
of this entry.
4. Analyzing Play
The term ‘game theory’ suggests that everything of
interest is captured in the format of a game with its moves and
outcomes. The present entry reassembles this perspective, considering
additional structure. A first extension was offered in
Section 3
,
 treating the nature of players as a topic in its own right. This
sections puts a spotlight on a second topic, game play in a wider
sense.
Many themes in the literature on logic and games fall into three
phases connected to play. Certain activities can already be conducted
before
the actual game. Examples are assessing the opponent
or forming a plan. Most relevant choices and decisions, however, take
place
during
the game — at least unless one thinks of players
as automata blindly following preset strategies. Lastly, also
after
a game significant activities occur. These involve
learning about opponent types, identifying crucial mistakes made, or
rationalizing the moves taken. In what follows, examples will be
presented of each phase.
4.1 Game Solution and Pregame Deliberation
When viewing games as static structures, rationality can be defined in
terms of coherence between players’
beliefs, preferences and choices or intentions
(Elster 1988). However, rationality
also describes a quality of behavior, related to how players act or
what they take advantage of when deliberating about a game. The
relation between both perspectives can be made concrete when
interpreting game solution procedures as styles of pregame
deliberation. To follow is a dynamic analysis of Backward Induction
(cf.
Section 3.3
)
 that differs conceptually from
characterization theorems
in terms of static properties such as common knowledge or common
belief. In the dynamic analysis, these group properties are not
assumed as preconditions. Rather, they are produced through the logic
of deliberation.
4.1.1 Backward Induction via public announcement
The Backward Induction algorithm is usually presented in a
quantitative setting, where each outcome is associated with utility
values for all players. (Leyton-Brown and
Shoham 2008). However, the same algorithm also works in a
qualitative setting, with attitudes expressed by a preference relation
between outcomes.
Backward Induction
Backward Induction computes
optimal moves for players. More specifically, at each choice node of
an extensive form game, one or more of the available moves is labeled
as optimal. For each player this set of optimal moves often forms a
strategy in the usual game-theoretic sense, i.e., a function selecting
a unique action to take at each of her choice nodes. Yet, there are
degenerate cases where backward induction merely creates a relational
strategy, restricting the available moves, while still leaving some
choices to the player.
The principle driving the Backward Induction algorithm is that no
player should ever select a move that is dominated by another move
available at the same moment. Dominance here works in a recursive
manner. Move
a
dominates move
b
if the corresponding
player prefers each final outcome reachable from
a
by following
Backward Induction moves to every outcome reachable from
b
by
Backward Induction moves.
Public announcement of rationality
In one
perspective, Backward Induction can be understood as a process of
prior-to-play deliberation, executed by players whose minds proceed in
harmony. Deliberation steps are repeated public announcements
(\(!\rat\)) of rationality-at-nodes:
\(\rat \)
no player arrived at the current node via a strictly dominated
move
Dominance here is a relation between the outcomes available after a
certain move has been made. In one interpretation, some move
a
dominates another move
b
if every outcome that remains
obtainable after
a
is preferred to any outcome reachable after
a
b
move. However, there is a dynamic twist: crucially, the
game tree considered, and hence the outcomes available, changes during
the deliberation procedure.
The semantics of
announcement updates
works by trimming models. \(!\varphi\) transforms a model
M
into a sub-model \(M_{|\varphi}\) consisting of all those points in
M
that satisfy \(\varphi\), while deleting all \(\neg\varphi\)
nodes. Relations on \(M_{|\varphi}\) are those inherited from
M
. Crucially, deletion may change the truth value of formulas:
after announcing \(!\varphi\), some nodes in \(M_{|\varphi}\) may
satisfy \(\neg\varphi\). In particular, with
M
the set of
points in a game tree, the set of available histories may keep
shrinking as successive announcements are made. Hence, repeated
announcements of \(!\rat \) make sense. In finite games, this process
always reaches a limit, a smallest subgame where no move is dominated
by another.
Example
Solving games through iterated assertions of
rationality.
Consider the following game, already introduced in
Section 1.1
.
 Iterated announcements of \(!\rat \) removes nodes that can only be
reached by dominated moves as long as this can be done. The trace of
this procedure is:
Figure 15.
ⓘ
Here, the Backward Induction solution emerges step by step. Stage 1 of
the procedure rules out the leaf labeled with (\(2,2\)) as the only
point where \(\rat \) fails. Stage 2 then rules out
E
’s
choice node as new node where \(\rat\) fails. In the resulting game
tree, \(\rat \) holds throughout.
More generally, let \((!\varphi, M)^\#\) be the limit (i.e., the first
fixed point) of
M
under repeatedly announcing \(\varphi\) as
long as it still true. In any game tree, the fixed-point \((!\rat ,
M)^\#\) has \(\rat\) true throughout. Its nodes contain the actual
play computed by the Backward Induction algorithm (van
Benthem 2014).
Limit behavior
Rationality is
‘self-fulfilling’ in the limit: if players commit to it in
deliberation for long enough, they prune away all irrational moves
and,
a fortiori
, all moves incompatible with common belief of
rationality. The final outcome is a model with rational play at every
point, a form of common knowledge of rationality. However, iterated
announcements can also yield a different type of limit behavior:
self-refutation. A prime example for this is the classic Muddy
Children puzzle (Gierasimczuk & Szymanik
2011) where repeatedly communicating ignorance leads to
knowledge in the end. Also within game theory, a number of situations
exist where (credible) announcements of future irrationality can leave
some player better off than the Backward Induction solution (Leyton-Brown
& Shoham 2008). Limit
behavior of announcements in infinite games is studied in Baltag,
Bezhanishvili & Fernández-Duque
(2022), linking up with Cantor’s derivative in classical
topology.
4.1.2 Backward Induction via belief revision
Iterated belief revision.
A different perspective of
pre-game deliberation is couched in terms of belief instead of
knowledge. The driving force here is rationality-in-belief:
\(\rat^*\)
players never chose any move dominated by another in light of
their beliefs how play will proceed from then on.
In this setting, the game tree itself remains invariant during
deliberation: no histories are removed or ruled out. What may change
instead is the relative plausibility of occurrence players assign to
end nodes or, in infinite games, histories.
In plausibility semantics (briefly introduced in
Section 3.6
),
 an agent believes propositions that hold true in all those
epistemically accessible worlds that are maximal in her plausibility
order. The corresponding dynamics of deliberation does not proceed by
point deletion, but by
soft updates
modifying the
agents’ plausibility ordering. For Backward Induction, a
‘radical upgrade’ \(\Uparrow\varphi\) suffices, that moves
all \(\varphi\)-worlds above all \(\neg\varphi\)-worlds states while
maintaining the ordering within these two sets (Baltag
& Smets 2008).
Here is how this mechanism works in a game setting. Start with all end
nodes equiplausible for all players. Since upgrades proceed by public
announcement, all players will share the same beliefs throughout. In
the procedure to follow, a move
x
is
dominated in
belief
by a move
y
of the same choice node if, in the
acting agent’s plausibility ordering, the most plausible end
nodes reachable after
y
are all better for her than each most
plausible end node compatible with move
x
. Now perform radical
upgrades of type
\(\Uparrow\rat^*\)
If
y
is dominated in belief by
x
, make all end nodes
following
x
more plausible than those after
y
.
Example
Backward Induction, soft version.
Here are the stages for the new procedure in the preceding example,
where the letters \(x, y, z\) stand for end nodes or histories of the
game:
Figure 16.
ⓘ
In the top node of the leftmost tree, going right is not dominated in
beliefs for player
A
by going left. So, \(\rat ^*\) only
affects
E
’s turn, and radical upgrade with \(\Uparrow\rat
^*\) makes \((0, 3)\) more plausible than \((2,2)\) . After this
change, going right has become dominated in beliefs in the top node,
and a new upgrade takes place, making
A
’s going left most
plausible.
Iterated upgrade with \(\rat ^*\) always stabilizes to a fixed
plausibility order, which is the same for all players. Identifying
each history of a game with its end node allows for a belief analysis
of Backward Induction (van Benthem &
Gheerbrant 2010). On finite trees, the histories emerging when
all players resort to their Backward Induction strategies exactly
correspond to the most plausible end nodes created by iterated radical
upgrade with rationality-in-belief. An alternative dynamic-epistemic
characterization of Backward Induction, using similar ideas in a
different mix, can be found in Baltag, Smets,
and Zvesper (2009).
Stabilization cannot be taken for granted. For other assertions
\(\varphi\), iterated upgrades \(\Uparrow\varphi\) can lead to
oscillating or divergent plausibility orders. However, this divergence
is limited. While cycles can occur for conditional beliefs, every
truthful iterated sequence of radical upgrades eventually stabilizes
all propositional beliefs (Baltag & Smets
2009).
Fixed-point logic
In a more technical perspective,
Backward Induction strategies can be defined as largest subrelation of
the total \(\move\) relation that has at least one successor at each
non-terminal node, while satisfying a confluence property between
action and preference:
\(CF(s)\)
\(\forall x\forall y(( \turn_i(x)\land xsy)\rightarrow\forall z
(x\, \move\, z\rightarrow\) \(\exists u\exists v(\sfend(u)\land
\sfend(v)\land y s^* v\land z s^* u\land u\leq_i v)))\)
This fact is the basis for proving that Backward Induction is
definable in First Order Fix point logic
LFP(FFO)
(van
Benthem & Gheerbrant 2010). Results
in this line of research connect game solution and game-theoretic
equilibria with fixed-point logics of computation. In simple settings,
such as that of Zermelo’s Theorem mentioned earlier, modal
fixed-point logics akin to μ-calculus suffice.
4.1.3 Iterated removal of strictly dominated strategies
Further game solution concepts can be analyzed with logics of iterated
update. In particular, iterated updates are not restricted to
extensive form games, but can also provide insights for games in
strategic form. A paradigmatic algorithm is Iterated Removal of
Strictly Dominated Strategies \((SD^\infty)\). In this setting, a
strategy is considered dominated if there exists another strategy that
yields a strictly higher payoff against any of the opponent’s
actions.
Example
Iterated removal of strictly dominated
strategies \((SD^\infty)\).
Consider the following matrix. As usual, pairs list
A
’s
utility first,
E
’s second.
E
a
b
c
A
d
2, 3
2, 2
1, 1
e
0, 2
4, 1
1, 0
f
0, 1
1, 4
2, 0
First remove the right-hand column, i.e.,
E
’s action
c
which is dominated by either of
a
and
b
. With
c
being removed,
A
’s action
f
has become
strictly dominated. After its removal,
E
’s action
b
becomes strictly dominated, and after that,
A
’s
action
e
. At the end of the process, iterated removal leaves
nothing but the state \((d,a)\), the game’s unique Nash
equilibrium. In general, the resulting game matrix after all removals
is guaranteed to contain all Nash equilibria of the original game, but
it may also contain further strategy combinations.
In this setting, the formal dynamic apparatus involves assertions
appropriate to the matrix games of
Section 2
.
 In fact, various different types of rationality can be defined in
logics for matrix games. Here is an illustration for two-player games,
involving announcements of ‘Weak Rationality’:
WR
Each player thinks that, compared with each of her available
alternative actions, her current move might be at least as good for
her.
This statement is the negation, for each player, of her current action
being strongly dominated. Naturally, this property can be expressed
formally with suitable epistemic action modalities. Yet, even as it
stands, it is clear that Weak Rationality can be announced to prune
away strategy profiles, and that in a iterated manner. The strategic
game will change every time weak rationality is announced, initiating
a stepwise process that resembles the earlier iterative announcements
of rationality for Backward Induction. As observed there, limits of
public announcements are always reached eventually, as models can only
get smaller. For announcing Weak Rationality, these limits match the
outcome of \(SD^\infty\) precisely (van Benthem
2007).
A similar style of analysis can be extended to other notions of
rationality. For instance, taking \(B_i\) to stand for ‘the
current action of player
i
is best for her against all actions
of the opponent’, the following formula may be dubbed strong
rationality
SR
\[\langle E\rangle B_E\land \langle A\rangle B_A\]
Briefly, the formula expresses that both players have a reasonable
hope of doing well.
Strong Rationality
in this sense is
related to the rationalizability program for game solution (Pearce
1964; de Bruin 2005), where actions
are discarded if a better response exists under all circumstances.
Strong Rationality, too, drives a game solution method.
Example
Updates with iterated announcements of strong
rationality (
SR
).
Consider a slight variation on the previous example. Below is the
sequence of updates for iterated announcements of strong rationality
\((\textit{SR}^\omega)\)
2, 3
2, 2
1, 1
0, 2
4, 1
1, 0
1, 1
3, 4
2, 0
2, 3
2, 2
0, 2
4, 1
1, 1
3, 4
2, 3
2, 2
0, 2
4, 1
2, 3
0, 2
2, 3
Each box may be viewed as an epistemic game model, as explained
earlier. Again, every step of announcement increases players’
knowledge, until a fixed-point is reached, constituting an equilibrium
where each player knows as much as they can.
Strong rationality is a more demanding condition than weak
rationality. While
SR
implies
WR
, there can be moves
that satisfy weak but not strong rationality. This shows in the
following difference between the current and the previous example. In
the present matrix, announcing Weak Rationality stops after the first
step elimination of action
c
. The reason is that, in the second
matrix, the row player’s bottom move is not strictly dominated
by any other action, so this row remains after re-announcing
WR
. However, under no possible circumstance is the row
player’s bottom action best for her. This contradicts strong
rationality and hence that row is eliminated by the next
SR
announcement. More generally, the game matrix resulting from
\((\textit{SR})^\infty\) is a sub-matrix of that produced by
\((\textit{WR})^\infty\). Notably, this is not entirely obvious, as
the two update sequences may produce different epistemic models
satisfying different formulas. A proof can be found in van
Benthem (2014).
Just as with Backward Induction, there are connections between
iterated announcements and fixed-point logics. The set of strategy
profiles that survive iterated announcements of strong rationality can
be defined in modal μ-calculi (Kozen 1983;
Venema 2008). If announcements are generalized to arbitrary
formulas, so-called deflationary fixed-point logics are needed for
studying limit behavior (Ebbinghaus & Flum
1995; Dawar, Grädel, & Kreutzer 2004).
Further game solution concepts have been analyzed in a similar dynamic
update style. The iterated regret minimization of Halpern
and Pass (2012), for instance, has
been captured in terms of iterated announcements (Cui
& Luo 2013).
It should be noted, that there are also more deductive takes on
solution concepts, where successive inferences assume the role of the
semantic updates above. A systematic proof-theoretic perspective on
game-theoretic reasoning toward solution can be found in de
Bruin (2005). Lastly, alternative analyses
of Strong and Weak Rationality as well as other game solution
concepts, in an abstract rewriting format of computational logic can
be found in Apt (2005).
Digression: comparing across representation levels
Different iterative announcement procedures lead to different analyses
of games. Moreover when comparing various procedures across different
frameworks, surprises may occur. For an illustration, take Backward
Induction. Its dynamic analysis produced a new ‘best move’
relation or plausibility order on an extensive form game. The
resulting strategy profiles may differ from a Nash equilibrium
analysis of the associated strategic form game:
Example
Backward Induction and Nash equilibria.
Consider the following game.
E
has no preferences between any
outcomes, but
A
does, as marked by the utility values.
Figure 17.
ⓘ
In the earlier BI analysis, neither move for
A
dominates the
other in beliefs, so no move is eliminated. Now consider the two
possible strategy profiles of each player and compute Nash
equilibria:
(
Left, right
) is not a Nash equilibrium, since
A
would
do better by playing
Right
, but
(Left, left)
is.
This illustrates differences in logical perspective on strategic and
extensive form games. Primitive elements of the former, strategies,
are complex objects in the latter’s game tree that cannot be
identified completely at the level of individual nodes alone. A
related point of connecting perspectives in classic game theory gave
rise to the concept of subgame perfect Nash equilibria (Selten
1975).
Further scenarios
Casting game solution in terms of
deliberation renders it an internal mental process: normally opponents
do not sit down together to discuss their game play in advance, but
reason about the opponents’ possible actions and considerations.
However, the deliberative techniques introduced above also apply to
real conversational scenarios. An example related to game theory is
the topic of disagreement, first introduced in an epistemic setting by
Aumann’s 1976
seminal agreeing to disagree result.
Dégremont and Roy (2012)
investigate this topic with techniques of dynamic logic, building on
classical results from Geanakoplos and
Polemarchakis (1982). In this framework, any dialogue where
agents keep stating whether or not they believe some formula
\(\varphi\) leads to agreement in the limit model, where updates no
longer have any effect. Briefly said, agents cannot disagree forever,
at least when starting with different hard information, while sharing
a well-founded plausibility order.
4.2 Information Flow, Knowledge, and Belief During Play
Game play is a dynamic process, where players repeatedly obtain new
information about other players. Certain aspects of information
collection are hard-wired into the game’s structure, such as
observing moves, or, in settings of imperfect observation, changing
from one information state to another. Other updates may be
extraneous, such as signals about the type of opponent one is dealing
with. As of now, there is no general logical theory encompassing all
these phenomena. Yet, instructive samples exist. The first topic to
address concerns the players’ knowledge, the second their
belief.
4.2.1 Epistemic update and imperfect information
In one perspective, games annotated with imperfect information cells
can be interpreted as recording a process of actual play. However, an
imperfect information tree does not suffice to fully specify the trace
of a real game. This raises the question on how to tease out what has
really happened. One style of analysis involves techniques from
dynamic-epistemic logic
.
 In this approach, players are assumed to have perfect recall, they do
not forget anything they once knew, while also satisfying No Miracles:
observation of actual game play is their only source of information,
(cf.
Section 3.6
).
In a first approximation, every move triggers a public announcement,
informing all players what just happened. Many games, however, include
partially observable moves, where some players merely learn that an
act has been performed, but not necessarily which. In this case,
information processing requires
product updates
from
dynamic-epistemic logic (cf. Baltag & Moss
2004), allowing for an appropriate mixture of knowledge and
uncertainty.
Example
Decorating a game tree by updates.
The left-hand side of the following diagram displays the game’s
bare action structure, without any information on observability.
However, when moving, players can distinguish their own actions, but
not all moves of their opponents. Their precise observational powers
are described by
event models
for the individual moves (cf.
van Ditmarsch, van der Hoek, & Kooi
2007).
Figure 18.
ⓘ
The observational structure on possible moves is encoded by relations
between the corresponding nodes, as described for games of imperfect
information
 (
Section 3.6
).
 Here are the successive updates that create the uncertainty links in
the tree:
Figure 19.
ⓘ
The resulting annotated tree is the following imperfect information
game:
Figure 20.
ⓘ
A similar analysis applies to infinite trees as well as to epistemic
forests (cf.
Section 3.6
).
 More generally, any imperfect information structure can arise from
information updates, provided players satisfy perfect recall and no
miracles, and moves in the game have logically definable preconditions
governing their availability. Precise formulations and proofs can be
found in van Benthem, Gerbrandy, Hoshi, and
Pacuit (2009). A generalization to game play without assumption
of synchronicity is provided in Dégremont,
Löwe, and Witzel
(2011).
No miracles and perfect recall are typical assumptions for most types
of agents in game theory. However, certain scenarios require
modifications, (cf. Osborne & Rubinstein
1994 on the ‘drunken driver’ scenario). Moreover,
if players are represented as finite automata, (cf.
Section 3.8
),
 perfect recall fails, and quite different patterns of uncertainty
become possible. Characterizations results for memory-free and
memory-bounded players can be found in Liu
(2011).
In addition to observational restrictions built into the game setup,
product updates can also model extraneous communication or other
information flow parallel to actual play. Some such scenarios will be
listed under Further Directions below.
4.2.2 Belief revision and Forward Induction
Certain types of information may be judged inconclusive or not fully
reliable. While unsuitable for advancing knowledge, such information
may prompt agents to alter some of their beliefs. Such inconclusive
evidence often concerns expectations concerning opponents’
player types. Leaving aside the possibility of mere mistakes, all
moves can be assumed to result from intentional, strategic
considerations. By interpreting opponents’ past moves, agents
may hence infer about their beliefs, preferences, risk attitudes or
reasoning types. Naturally, most such observations are not fully
conclusive. The corresponding updates hence cannot delete any
alternatives. Rather, they merely change the agent’s
plausibility ordering \(\leq_i\) among different options. Formally,
this can be handled with the plausibility updates introduced for
Backward Induction. However, the interpretation differs. Here, these
updates do not represent steps in pregame deliberation, but result
from actual moves during the game. Besides the radical upgrade
introduced above, a number of further updating policies reflecting
different attitudes to the information acquired are defined in Baltag
and Smets (2008). The
epistemic-plausibility patterns that can arise from systematic
plausibility update in games have been identified in Dégremont
(2010), using two
counterparts of the earlier perfect recall and no miracles properties:
‘Plausibility Revelation’ and ‘Plausibility
Propagation’.
These results refer to but one aspect of belief in games. There are
others. A further type of belief describes agents prior attitudes to
the game, generated by past experience or deliberation. Another refers
to the agents’ beliefs about where they are located in the game
tree, based on previous observations during play. To keep these
notions separate, one might distinguish between more local
‘beliefs’ during play and future-oriented
‘expectations’ about the game’s progression.
Plausibility orders created by Backward Induction, for instance,
describe expectations about future game play. These are not based on
observations already made in the present game, and significantly, fail
to satisfy the properties of plausibility revelation and propagation.
Here is a particular strand of logical belief and its revision that is
of independent game-theoretic interest.
Forward Induction
Suppose some player has deviated
from her Backward Induction strategy as computed in pre-game
deliberation. What are others to make of this? Answers offered in the
literature range from interpreting the deviation as an error without
any future implications (Aumann 1995) to
treating it as significant in various ways (Bicchieri
1993). In the latter vein, the
deviation could be a signal for cooperation (believable or not), a
sign of limited resources, or it could reveal other relevant
information about the player’s type.
More explicitly, the situation has the following aspects. At any stage
of a game, players have several types of information, including their
prior expectations of how the game would proceed and the perhaps
surprising observations made along the way. If the game is to continue
further, as in the state marked below, agents need to integrate both
into expectations about the future course of the game.
Figure 21.
ⓘ
Rationalizing
There is no unique best way of
integrating information of the various kinds. Yet, a natural option is
to maintain the assumption of opponents’ rationality, taken in
the earlier sense. Assuming preferences to be common knowledge,
observed moves hence provide new information about the
opponent’s belief. More specifically, these beliefs have two
components: expectations about what other players will do, and
intentions about their own future actions. The driving principle will
then be
Rationalizing
By playing a
move, a rational player communicates that this move is not strictly
dominated-in-beliefs for her.
Clearly, rationalizing can only be maintained as long as the player
does not choose a move that is strictly dominated under all
circumstances. In that case, one must ascend a ladder of further
hypotheses about the opponent, including the possibility of her making
mistakes.
Reasoning policies of the above type are called
Forward
Induction
. Battigalli and Siniscalchi (2002) and Brandenburger
(2007), analyze Forward Induction in extensive form games based on its
known tight connection with Iterated Removal of Weakly Dominated
Strategies in strategic form games. The following example involving
explicit reasoning is from Perea
(2012).
Example
A Forward Induction scenario.
Figure 22.
ⓘ
In the matrix game, no move dominates any other. Hence
E
should
consider all outcomes possible. In this case, going
left
is
safer for her than going
right
, and hence
A
should
play
Left
at the start. However, if
E
rationalizes,
and observes
A
going
Right
, she has extra information
available at her choice node. Following the rationality assumption,
A
expects to do better than 3, which is only possible if he
intends to play
Up
in the matrix game. Now this tells
E
to proceed to the matrix and play the
left
column
therein.
E
’s results in a better payoff than the 2 of her
original safe option.
From a logical perspective, a study of Forward Induction requires
epistemic-doxastic models with ternary world-dependent plausibility
relations, combined with the public announcement updates or
plausibility upgrade described above (
Section 4.1.2
;
 see. also van Benthem 2014). No definitive logical analysis of
Forward Induction has been published so far.
4.2.3 Post-game rationalization
Comparatively little attention has been paid in the literature to what
players do after a game. Yet, these follow up-activities are often
crucial, for instance to establish general lessons learned that may be
valuable for future game play. Such interpretations are especially
prominent in small or isolated groups, where the same opponent might
be encountered again in the future.
Preference change after a game
At a simple level,
post-game activity can consist in setting, or altering, the second
input parameter of rational choice beside belief: the players’
preferences. Several folklore results relate to this option. For
instance, when playing against a given strategy of another player with
known preferences, any strategy can be rationalized by choosing
suitable preferences among outcomes. Liu
(2011) discusses several preference based rationalization
algorithms using dynamic logics of preference change.
Preference change can also occur during a game. Players may receive
new information about the game’s end states and their
properties. They may also follow a command or a suggestion from an
authority, establishing a preference or reversing an earlier one.
Relatedly, players may change their external goals pursued in the
game, or they may adjust their preferences for more internal reasons,
as in the phenomenon of ‘sour grapes’ (Elster
1983).
4.2.4 Play in a long-term temporal perspective
The main focus of this section is the local dynamics of what happens
before, during and after a single game. There is also a broader
perspective of time, in which all these activities are embedded in an
extended temporal universe, large enough to include all possible
trajectories of the game, finite or just as well infinite. In
evolutionary game theory
,
 in particular, infinite games typically arise from iterated play of
finite games, with Lewis’
signaling games (2002) as prominent
example in philosophy.
Assuming an extended infinite temporal perspective raises additional
questions about players’ strategic foresight and adaptation
(Christoff 2016). Various long-term
perspectives differ drastically in this respect, ranging from the
minimal rationality assumptions typical of evolutionary game theory to
high reasoning complexities of agents anticipating the long term
effects of their choices.
Temporal logics
While infinite game forms were
briefly alluded to in
Section 2.10
,
 infinite play focuses on agency over time. A host of temporal logics
for this end have been put forward, including interpreted systems
(Fagin, Halpern et al. 1995),
epistemic-temporal logic (Parikh &
Ramanujam 2003), STIT (Belnap &
Perloff 1988; Horty & Belnap 1995), ATL (Alur,
Henzinger, & Kupferman 2002; van der Hoek
& Wooldridge 2003), and others. Many of these systems
combine multiple modalities. Consequentially, their complexity can be
very high (undecidable, non-axiomatizable, or even non-arithmetical),
as Halpern & Vardi (1986) show in a
pioneering study for the case of combining time and knowledge.
Surveying this area is beyond the scope of this entry, cf. the entry
on
temporal logics
.
 A unifying view of connections between the various paradigms is
presented in van Benthem and Pacuit
(2006).
Figure 23.
ⓘ
Just as with finite games, players’ preferences must be
specified for studying equilibria in potentially infinite games. In
lack of outcome nodes or final moments to attach preferences to, these
are naturally thought of in terms of players’ goals, expressed
as properties the game’s histories should satisfy. Such goals
can be local propositional facts true at some particular moment. But
goals can also concern global properties of histories such as avoiding
or reaching the same position some specified number of times, or more
abstractly, achieving safety or fairness in some appropriate sense.
All such properties can be specified in temporal logics. For the case
of Linear Temporal Logic (
LTL
), the ‘Boolean
games’ of Gutierrez, Harrenstein, and
Wooldridge (2015) have developed the temporal goal based
approach in depth. Notably, this framework validates a logical version
of the ‘folk theorem’ for iterated games, cf. Osborne
& Rubinstein (1994): Under natural
conditions on goals, iterated games can have novel equilibria not
supervenient on the base game’s Nash equilibria. Further
significant uses of temporal logics connect game theory with belief
revision theory (Battigalli & Bonanno 1999;
Perea 2012; Stalnaker 1998).
Evolutionary game theory and dynamical systems
A
prominent application of iterated games occurs in evolutionary game
theory (Maynard Smith 1982; Hofbauer &
Sigmund 1998; Gintis 2000), a framework that has many
applications in biology, formal sociology, but also linguistics and
philosophy (Lewis 2002; Skyrms 2010; Alexander
2007; Clark 2012).
Little work has been done so far on the logical analysis of
evolutionary games along the dimensions of this entry. In fact, there
are striking conceptual differences between evolutionary games and the
style of analysis pursued here that might be dubbed ‘high
rationality’-oriented. Rather than incorporating intentional,
strategic actors, evolutionary games work by temporal progression of a
dynamical system which is driven by individuals’ fitness values
derived from game-like encounters with others. Within such systems,
behavior is not driven by belief updates or complex strategic
considerations. Rather, players typically display ‘low
rationality, following certain hard-wired strategies. Much of the
evolutionary system’s dynamics is then driven by changes in the
population’s composition of strategy types.
Even so, evolutionary game theory does invite connections to logic.
The evolutionary success of simple strategies like Tit-for-Tat (Axelrod
& Hamilton 1981) raises the
question of just when complex logically based high-rationality
strategies can be replaced by equally efficient alternatives simple
enough to be played by automata or similar models of bounded agents,
(Grädel, Thomas, & Wilke 2002).
At a higher level of abstraction, there also is an incipient line of
research into the connection between logic and dynamical systems, a
standard tool for analyzing evolutionary games. This strand includes a
bimodal topological logic of time (Kremer &
Mints 2007), fixed-point logics of oscillation (van
Benthem 2015), and a systematic linkage
between dynamic-epistemic update logics and dynamical systems over
metric spaces (Klein & Rendsvig
2019; 2020). At a much concreter level, one important species of
evolutionary games are signaling games (Lewis
2002; Cho & Kreps 1987; Osborne & Rubinstein 1994; Skyrms
2010: van Rooy 2004), where agents send and receive signals
about the state of the world. Signaling games match up naturally with
the earlier dynamics logic of information flow during play.
4.3 Conclusion: Theory of Play
Topics discussed in this section are less standard in the literature
than those of the sections before. In an orthodox reading, various of
the aspects addressed would not be considered part of game theory
proper. The extended agenda followed here has been embraced by van
Benthem, Pacuit, and Roy (2011) as a
larger program for logic, going under the heading ‘Theory of
Play’. The underlying line of reasoning is that games do not
fully determine their outcomes, as they allow for various styles of
play. Hence, it might be the process of play itself, including
players’ types and how they change over time, that might the
best focus for understanding interaction, rather than mere games or
game forms alone. Similar lines of argument can be found in the
foundations of computation where it has been proposed that the
essential topic of study should be
behavior
(Abramsky
2008).
4.4 Further Directions
Belief revision and learning theory
Belief revision
in repeated games bears natural resemblance to limit learning of
formal learning theory
(Kelly 1996). Baltag,
Gierasimczuk, and Smets (2011) analyze
learning in terms of initial epistemic-doxastic models over which
finite histories of signals trigger the learner to revise beliefs,
represented as changes in epistemic accessibility or plausibility
order. It turns out that both iterated public announcement and
iterated radical upgrade as discussed above are universal learning
methods, though only the latter maintains this property in the
presence of (finitely many) errors in the input stream.
Goal dynamics and intentions
While preferences and
goals have so far been assumed fixed and universally known, this is by
no means necessary. van Otterloo (2005)
presents a dynamic logic of strategic powers, where information about
players’ intentions and preferences can be announced during
play. Roy (2008) uses announcements of
intentions to obtain simplified solution procedures for strategic
games. More concrete scenarios of extraneous information flow are
found in Parikh, Taşdemı̇r, and
Witzel (2013), where agents manipulate the knowledge of others
during play.
Game change
In many real life scenarios, players do
not know the full game tree they are playing. Even if they did, it
might change during play. Or, at least, players may attempt to change
the game. A concrete example is provided by the game tree in
Section 4.1.1
.
 There, the inefficient Backward induction outcome \((1, 0)\) could be
avoided by
E
promising not to go left. When made binding (for
instance through imposing a fine) this announcement eliminates
histories and, consequentially, a new backward Induction outcome of
\((2,2)\) results. Hence, both players can be made better off by
restricting the freedom of one. Game theory has sophisticated analyses
of such scenarios, including an analysis of ‘cheap talk’
(Osborne & Rubinstein 1994), asking
when such announcements are credible. On the logical side, this
suggests an analysis of signaling games (van
Rooy 2004). We are not aware of any logical work done in this
direction.
Real games
The discrepancy between specification of a
game and the realities of play is especially striking in real game
play, either of the ‘natural kind’ in common parlor games
(van Ditmarsch & Kooi 2015), or of
the artificial kind found in the laboratory experiments of
experimental game theory (Camerer 2003).
Little work has been done by logicians in this realm, though there is
a broad tradition of computational analysis of games (Schaeffer
& van der Herik 2002; Kurzen
2011). Any adequate logical analysis would clearly need to
incorporate the considerations on bounded agency discussed in
Section 3
.
Mathematical foundations
Logic of play as discussed
here raises issues of how to interfaces local with global dynamics.
This shows in particular with logical limit behavior, where
observations and assertions are made repeatedly. Limit models of
public announcement, as described earlier, can be
‘self-fulfilling’ or ’self-refuting’. In the
first case, the property asserted becomes common knowledge among all
agents, whereas in the second it eventually becomes false at the
actual world. With soft update on plausibility models, a third option
arises, namely, infinite oscillation, or even divergence (Baltag
& Smets 2009). To date, there is
no general logical theory of these phenomena, but see van
Benthem (2011) on the use of fixed-point
logics for limit models, Miller and Moss
(2005) on the high complexity of public announcement logic with
finitely iterated announcements, and Klein and
Rendsvig (2017) on limit behavior of product updates.
The topic of limit behavior also raises the issue of how local dynamic
logics of agency relate to the global temporal logics discussed in
Section 4.2.4
.
 Towards clarifying the connection, van
Benthem, Gerbrandy, Hoshi, and Pacuit (2009), show how
dynamic-epistemic logics can be seen as decidable fragments of more
expressive temporal logics. Baltag, Smets, and
Zvesper (2009) discuss the related theme of how dynamic
representations can decrease complexity by shifting information from
the temporal universe to dynamic events.
5. Interfacing Logic and Probability in Games
Probabilities are central to game theory, where they serve two
prominent roles. First, they structure players’ uncertainty
about various aspects of the game, including the state of nature, the
type of opponent faced, and past, present, and future moves of other
players. Second, ever since the origins of Game Theory (von
Neumann & Morgenstern 1944),
probabilistic randomization has served to expand the agents’
space of possible actions. While the interpretation of such mixed
strategies has been the subject of extensive debate (Sugden
1991), it is uncontroversial that
randomized moves add significant depth to the analysis of games. In
fact, the concept of mixed strategies is vital for a number of seminal
results in classic game theory including the existence of Nash
equilibria in finite games of imperfect information.
Probability and its logic is a major topic in both mathematics and
philosophy, as discussed in the entries on
interpretations of probability
,
 and
logic and probability
.
 The current section merely outlines a few key connections between
probability and the logical analysis of games. The following
presentation assumes all state spaces to be finite, ignoring important
technical and conceptual issues around the transition from finite to
infinite state spaces.
5.1 Probabilities and Beliefs
Probabilistic methods are widely employed to represent beliefs of
agents within and outside of games, witness
Bayesian epistemology
.
 Typically, a probabilistic belief model consists of two components: a
space of possible states that the agent’s beliefs range over,
plus a quantitative probability function denoting how probable the
agent judges different propositions or states to be. In qualitative
logical models, on the other hand, agentive belief is represented in
varying degree of detail. The coarsest approach only distinguishes
states the agent considers possible from those she rules out. This is
the perspective of standard epistemic-doxastic logics, such as
multi-agent S5 and KD45 discussed in
Section 3.6
.
 More fine-grained perspectives are employed in the plausibility
models of Boutilier (1994) and Baltag
and Smets (2008), where the range of
epistemic options is structured further by plausibility orderings
encoding which options agents take to be less or more likely. See also
Sections
3.6.4
and
4.2
.
Both probabilistic and plausibilistic perspectives can express that
some alternative is more likely than another. However, there are also
conceptual differences between the two frameworks. Probabilistic
models can aggregate, allowing their logic to express, for instance,
whether many low-probability events combined can outweigh even the
highest-probability worlds. Aggregated probabilities play a key role,
for instance, in calculations of expected utility. Yet no such thing
can be expressed in plausibility semantics. For another striking
difference, plausibility models lead to a notion of belief that is
closed under conjunction. This conjunction closure typically fails for
probabilistic accounts of belief. See however Leitgeb
(2017) for a sophisticated bridge
between both types of modeling.
5.2 From Logic to Probability and Back
On a received view, logical and probabilistic frameworks emphasize
different aspects of belief. Logic emphasizes coherence properties
between the propositions believed, such as closure under logical
implications or conjunction. Probabilistic reasoning, on the other
hand, stresses graded information and attitudes towards uncertain
events such as lotteries. Even so, there is a variety of approaches
attempting to unify the two types of reasoning by constructing bridges
between the frameworks.
From qualitative to quantitative probability
Early
attempts in this direction go back to Finetti
(1970 [1974]), striving for a purely qualitative axiomatization
of probability theory. A step further towards logical reasoning are
various theories of qualitative probability (Kyburg
1994), often based on the assumption
that classical quantitative notions of probability are too demanding
for real-life agents. In this line of research agents need only reason
with partial, comparative probability assessments, rather than having
fully specified probabilities for all events. Logical frameworks for
qualitative probability include Segerberg
(1971), Fagin, Halpern, and Megiddo (1990), and Delgrande
and Renne (2015). While differing in
detail, all logics in this line have in common that they allow for
expressions of the form \(\varphi\preceq\psi\), indicating that
\(\psi\) is judged at least as probable at \(\varphi\). Recent
frameworks add various additional refinements to this language.
Similarly, Heifetz and Mongin (2001)
expand the axiomatic analysis of probabilistic beliefs to higher order
reasoning, working on probabilistic type space akin to those
introduced in
Section 3.7
.
Yet, the concept of qualitative probability is sometimes considered
flawed: a complete set of probabilistic-logical principles
guaranteeing that every complete description in the logical language
corresponds to a unique probability measure turns out to require a
complex calculus, involving an opaque infinite rule (Kraft,
Pratt, & Seidenberg 1959; Scott
1964). A new angle has been proposed in Harrison-Trainor,
Holliday, and Icard (2016) and
Ding, Holliday, and Icard (2021)  through axiomatizing a
low-complexity qualitative probabilistic logic that emerges from
relaxing the above unique correspondence requirement to merely
requiring compatibility with all probability measures of a certain
family.
However, none of the frameworks described here are specific for games.
In fact, it remains to be seen whether qualitative probabilistic
logics, old or recent, can be used for a qualitative analysis of
game-theoretic solution concepts.
From quantitative to qualitative probability
While
the preceding line of research aims at recovering quantitative
probability from qualitative notions, a converse project shows how
ubiquitous qualitative patterns might arise naturally within a
quantitative probabilistic setting. Building on what is sometimes
dubbed the Lockean Thesis,
threshold approaches
connect
probability to logic by stipulating that some \(\varphi\) is to be
believed simpliciter if the probability of \(\varphi\) is above some
appropriate numerical threshold
t
. For most choices of
threshold
t
, such translations do not square well with standard
logical desiderata, as beliefs will in general not be closed under
conjunction. However, in recent work Leitgeb
(2017) and Lin and Kelly (2012)
have identified conditions under which one can do better. Building on
ideas of Skyrms (1977), Leitgeb
identifies strong, context-dependent
‘robustness conditions’ on thresholds that guarantee the
defined belief operator to satisfy the KD45 axioms after all. Lin
and Kelly, on the other hand, work with
non-uniform thresholds for transitioning between logical and
probabilistic notions of belief, allowing to derive coherence between
different forms of belief dynamics on the two sides. For a recent
study of the mathematical foundations and limits of these approaches,
as well as the conditional logics they generate see Mierzewski
(2020).
5.3 Updating and Tracking Probabilities
In the dynamic perspective of game play, every move constitutes a new
piece of information agents have to take into account. Besides,
players may also change their beliefs about the game upon
deliberation, through communication or any other signals they receive,
be they reliable or not ( cf.
Section 4
).
 All such dynamic events raise the question of how new information is
to be incorporated into the agents’ beliefs and when
probabilistic updates have corresponding logical revisions or vice
versa.
If the new information is of the hard type, accepted as irrevocably
true by all agents, the probabilistic counterpart of logical public
announcements is Bayesian conditioning. Both notions track each other
at a semantic level, meaning that their outputs amount to the same
thing. Computing beliefs after a public announcement means recomputing
in the submodel consisting of all states where the information
received was true. This is exactly the same mechanism as for
recalculating probabilities in Bayesian update. Moreover, for
reasoning about updates, both approaches require conditional notions:
conditional belief and conditional probability respectively. The
quantitative notion of conditional belief relates to the logical
notion of conditional belief \(B(\varphi|\psi)\), with the slight
caveat that the latter also allows for epistemic or doxastic operators
inside either argument. More refined logical notions of conditional
belief arise in the earlier-mentioned plausibility semantics of
Section 4.1.2
,
 (Baltag & Smets 2008).
Given the co-existence of qualitative and quantitative perspectives,
it makes sense to ask whether one can
track
the other. In a
static sense, tracking asks whether different notions of belief can be
translated into each other by omitting or transforming some of the
semantic details involved. A dynamic interpretation expands on this by
asking whether updating, either in the hard or soft varieties of
Section 4
,
 is compatible with these translations in a commutative diagram:
Information update in a new perspective after translation should yield
same result as first performing a matching update in the old
perspective and then translating (van Benthem
2016). In games, the topic of tracking may refer not just to
information update, but also to solution concepts or moves in game
play described at the various levels considered in
Section 2
.
The existence of tracking maps depends on the exact type of update
considered. By now there is a wide variety of updating policies on
plausibility models (van Benthem & Smets
2015), not all of which have obvious probabilistic
counterparts. Likewise, for well-known varieties of probabilistic
update, such as Jeffrey update, where the probability of selected
propositions can be reset at will, plausibility counterparts are not
easy to find, though the attempt of van
Benthem, Gerbrandy, and Kooi (2009) modifies dynamic-epistemic
logic to allow for Jeffrey update and other generalized probabilistic
policies.
5.4 Specializing to Games
Virtually all aspects of game theory provide contacts between logical
and probabilistic perspectives. Clearly, this is true for the
different representations of knowledge, beliefs and their dynamics
just discussed. Other contacts occur at the level of game forms, cf.
Section 2
,
 where probabilities enrich the space of strategies. The resulting
mixed moves require players to expand their preferences to mixed
outcomes, cf.
Section 3
.
 Finally, at the level of reasoning about game play, cf.
Section 4
,
 probabilistic beliefs play a role in solution techniques such as
dominance or expected utility based reasoning.
Available actions and mixed strategies
Probabilistic
mixtures of pure strategies are prominent in game theory, as they can
secure outcomes and payoffs that no pure strategy alone could
guarantee.
Example
Matching Pennies.
Consider the well-known game of matching pennies in matrix form:
Bob
x
y
Ann
a
1,−1
−1, 1
b
−1,1
1,−1
For Ann, a mixed strategy of playing
a
exactly half of the time
guarantees an expected outcome of 0, no matter what Bob does. No pure
strategy could have achieved this.
From a logical point of view, mixed strategies can be conceptualized
as new primitive actions in the earlier logics of games ( cf.
Section 2
).
 Yet, this treatment immediately renders the set of available actions
infinite. A cautiously refined logical language, extending logical
approaches to qualitative probability, can allow for expressions such
as an agent playing action
a
with probability at least
q
, (Delgrande and Renne
2015).
A more challenging general question is how to relate classic
probabilistic approaches with their fixed-point results and ensuing
equilibrium existence theorems, with the logical fixed-point
approaches mentioned at several places in this entry. The latter
operate with step-by-step ordinal iterations, as opposed to the
gradual, approximative procedures that underlie the Brouwer or
Kakutani fixed-point theorems relevant for classical game theory. A
related question is just how much logic is needed to reproduce
probabilistic existence theorems within a qualitative framework.
Adding players’ preferences
Once preferences
are added, mixed strategies trigger additional intricacies. A strategy
profile where some players pursue mixed strategies does not produce a
unique outcome, but a weighted combination of outcomes. Thus,
permitting mixed strategies requires lifting preference relations to
probabilistic mixtures of outcomes or strategy profiles. Incorporating
such mixtures may implicitly depart from the standard, purely
qualitative perspective on outcomes (Ramsey
1931; Savage 1954).
Example
Extended preference comparison.
The following two games are equivalent in terms of qualitative (i.e.,
ordinal) preferences between outcomes for both players. However, they
differ in preferences between mixed outcomes, with
\[0.5(b,x)+0.5(b,y)\succeq_A (a,x)\]
holding in the game to the left, but not in that to the right.
x
y
a
1,0
2,1
b
0,1
4,0
x
y
a
1,0
2,1
b
−10,1
4,0
Going this way poses some logical challenges. For example, consider a
preference relation over probabilistic mixtures of outcomes, where
\(m^t(a,b)\) stands for obtaining
a
with a probability of
t
, and
b
otherwise. This setting is in the scope of
von Neumann and Morgenstern’s
1944 well-known ‘continuity
axiom’ that is characterized by an implicit infinite
disjunction:
\[ {a \preceq b\preceq c} \Rightarrow  {\exists t \in(0,1):\ m^t(a,c)\preceq b \preceq  m^{1-t}(a,c)} \]
This seems well beyond the expressive power of standard probabilistic
logics.
Solution concepts and game play
Probabilization also
impact the process of game play and its reasoning dynamics, for
instance by changing the earlier-mentioned calculus of weak and strong
dominance
 (
Section 3.4
).
 Consider the following game, cf. de Bruin
(2005):
B
x
y
A
a
0, 5
5, 0
b
5, 0
0, 5
c
1, 1
1, 1
None of
A
’s strategies are dominated in terms of pure
strategies. However, in terms of expected outcomes,
c
is
dominated by an equal mixture of
a
and
b
. Thus, solution
procedures analyzed earlier such as iterated removal of weakly or
strongly dominated strategies may provide different and incompatible
outcomes, depending on whether mixed strategies are considered or not.
No satisfactory logical analysis of the earlier kind seems to exist
for this setting.
5.5 Further Challenges for a Logical Approach
Further challenges to the interplay of logic and probabilistic
reasoning abound. By way of conclusion, here is a dimension that seems
hard to capture in purely qualitative logical terms. A characteristic
feature of game- and decision-theoretic reasoning is that beliefs and
preferences are
entangled
in various ways (Liu
2011). For instance, the crucial notion
of expected utility entangles probability, representing beliefs, with
utilities, standing for preferences. Players faced with probabilistic
uncertainty about the opponent’s present and future actions are
often advised to maximize expected utility (von
Neumann & Morgenstern 1944; Savage 1954). Hence, even if
one has found qualitative counterparts for probabilistic belief and
cardinal utility separately, entanglement poses the additional
difficulty of merging these two qualitative analyses in a way that
matches what the quantitative side achieves easily by forming some
arithmetical combination of both components.
6. Gamification
The main topic of this entry is a logical approach to game theory,
bringing classical notions and methods from logic to bear upon games.
This project is sometimes called ‘logic of games’. There
also is a converse direction of ‘logic as games’, where
game theoretic concepts are employed to elucidate basic notions of
logic. This section presents a brief discussion on this direction as a
natural counterpoint to the main lines of the entry. For an extensive
survey see the entries on
logic and games
and
games, abstraction and completeness
.
6.1 Logic Games
Many notions in logic have been analyzed in game-theoretic terms
Evaluation games
There are well-known two-player
games for evaluating a first-order formula \(\varphi\) within a given
logical model. These games are played between Verifier and Falsifier,
who can both test atomic assertions, and specify the value of
variables from a given domain (Hintikka
1973). The schedule of the game is determined from the
syntactic structure of the formula \(\varphi\). Disjunctions and
existential quantifiers require choices of the Verifier, conjunctions
and universal quantifiers of the Falsifier, and negations trigger a
role switch between the two players. The result is the following match
between winning strategies and the ordinary semantic notion of
truth:
Formula \(\varphi\) is true in model
M
under assignment
s
iff the Verifier has a winning strategy in the associated
game \(game(M, s, \varphi)\).
Correspondingly, Falsifier has a winning strategy if the formula
\(\varphi\) is false in the model. Evaluation games turn out to be an
extremely flexible tool. By suitably modulating rules and winning
conventions, adequate evaluation games can be found for most logical
systems. Doing so, however, can be a highly non-trivial task, as
witnessed by the intricate infinite ‘parity games’
corresponding to fixed-point logics such as the modal μ-calculus
(Venema 2008). For the present purpose,
it should be noted that this style of analysis ties the very logical
operations, conjunctions, disjunctions, modal operators, to natural
moves in a game. Similarly, the notion of truth is linked to the
fundamental game-theoretic notion of a strategy in an extensive form
game (cf.
Section 2
):
 a complex, structured object which may here be understood as a reason
or an explanation for the truth or falsity of the formula.
The links between both perspectives are so close, that valid
principles of logic come to express game-theoretic facts. For
instance, after a little analysis, the law of excluded middle implies
that always either Verifier or Falsifier has a winning strategy, cf.
Section 2.4
.
 In other words, logical evaluation games for classical logic are
determined in the game-theoretic sense. In fact, This property extends
to most games for non-classical logics.
Further logic games
Logic games exist for many other
purposes. Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games serve model comparison
(Ehrenfeucht 1961; Ebbinghaus & Flum
1995), Lorenzen games perform proof analysis (Kamlah
1973 [1984]) and tableau games execute
model construction (Hodges 1985). In
each case, strategies in the game match important logical notions. In
Lorenzen dialogue games, for instance, winning strategies for the
Proponent of a claim correspond to proofs of that claim from premises
granted by the Opponent, whereas winning strategies for the Opponent
are constructions of counter-models. Thus, proofs and models, two
quite distinct notions in logic, co-exist within a single game.
There exists an alternative, game-theoretic way of interpreting these
connective results. Suppose the game under study is fixed, and
associated with some sort of ‘game board’ representing
major features of the game’s general state (think of Chess,
though more abstract game boards may occur). Then the above
equivalences suggest that winning strategies, i.e., a typical
game-theoretic notion defined in terms of the complete extensive game
tree, is equivalent to a simpler ‘invariant’ that can be
defined entirely in terms of some game board associated with the
tree’s nodes. Identifying useful such invariants is a well-known
art in the analysis of concrete games. In terms of a main theme of
this entry, invariants can live at different levels of representation
associated with a given class of games.
Game semantics
One can view logic games as mere
didactic devices analyzing logical notions that were already
well-understood. Or, in other terms, as offering a concrete way of
teaching logic that draws on game-theoretic intuitions. However, logic
games have more to offer. First of all, new logics are suggested by
pursuing natural variations in winning conventions, moves, or
scheduling within existing logic games. Moreover, viewing logical
operations as game constructors suggests a new, refined view on
logical constants. Conjunction, for instance, now splits naturally
into a sequential and a parallel version. Similar examples of
parallelism also exist in logics of computation. Moreover, associating
quantifiers with object picking, as in evaluation games, turns
quantifiers into special types of atomic games that connect to the
following formula by an abstract operation of game composition. The
general logic of this abstract composition operation combined with
propositional operations of choice and switch has been shown
decidable, providing a new decidable core logic inside first-order
logic whose existence had not been suspected (van
Benthem 2014). Games, hence, can offer a
fresh perspective on existing logical systems.
A major source of independent, game-theoretic perspectives on logic is
the game semantics of computational logics (Abramsky
1997). In this setting, the status
of logic games may change. Rather than being a mere pedagogical or
exploratory device, to some, these games are considered the true
meaning of logical constants. In this setting, infinite games are
often the paradigm, standing for ongoing processes, rather than finite
terminating games. This shows in the importance of infinite parity
games for the modal μ-calculus, Venema
(2008), as well as in the earlier-mentioned co-algebraic
perspective on games. Baltag, van Benthem &
Westerståhl (forthcoming) discuss the outside-in
perspective of co-algebraic game semantics as a viable general
paradigm for linguistic meaning representing a significant shift in
standard discussions of compositionality.
6.2 Other Logic-Related Games
The distinction between game logics and logic games is not always
sharp. Recent literature has seen a number of games whose design is
connected to logic, yet they are not meant to analyze logical notions
per se. Many of these games are played on graphs, as underlying game
boards where players can perform different moves. Graph games are
widely used in the computational literature for analyzing logical and
algorithmic tasks ( Flum, Grädel &
Wilke 2007). However, in this section, we merely highlight one
particular kind of graph game for its fruitful connections with logic
which suggests a number of unusual issues.
Example
Sabotage Games.
Sabotage games were proposed to analyze algorithmic tasks in adverse
circumstances. Consider the below network between some European
cities:
Figure 24.
ⓘ
It is easy to travel either way between Amsterdam and the German town
of Saarbruecken. Now, let a malevolent Demon start canceling
connections in the network. At every stage, let the Demon take out one
link, while the Traveler can afterwards follow one of the remaining
links. This turns a one-agent planning problem into a two-player
sabotage game. Zermelo-style reasoning shows that, from Saarbruecken,
a German Traveler still has a winning strategy, while in Amsterdam,
the Demon has the winning strategy against the Dutch Traveler, by
first cutting a link close to Saarbruecken. The symmetry of the
original search problem is broken.
The sabotage game has been applied to a variety of scenarios,
including learning (Gierasimczuk, Kurzen, &
Velázquez-Quesada 2009), and communication networks
(Aucher, van Benthem, & Grossi
2018). On finite graphs, the game is clearly determined, with
the computational complexity of identifying who has a winning strategy
being Pspace-complete (Löding & Rohde
2003).
The existence of this winning strategy can be expressed by a
first-order formula. More specifically, winning conditions can be
defined in a bimodal logic that combines a standard modality for
travel steps with a new modality for one-step arrow deletion,
interpreted in models \(M = (W, R, V)\):
\(M, s \vDash [{-}]\varphi\quad\) For each edge \((u, v)\) in \(R:\,
\, (W, R {-} \{(u. v)\}, V) \vDash \varphi\)
This logic fits the sabotage game closely. On top, it is a natural
fragment of the first-order language of graphs. Surprisingly, this
logic is undecidable (Löding & Rohde
2003), making it one of the simplest examples of an undecidable
modal logic over arbitrary models.
Further graph games in a similar spirit exist, including the poison
game of Duchet and Meyniel (1993), where
the Demon poisons nodes, rather than deleting edges. Extensive studies
of modal logics for changing graphs, and μ-calculi for defining
generic solutions to graph games are given in Areces,
Figueira et al. (2011); Areces, Fervari, and
Hoffmann (2015); and Aucher, van Benthem & Grossi (2018). A
classification of graph games including the effects of complex goal
formulas and imperfect information is found in van
Benthem and Liu (2019).
One perspective on such logics for reasoning about model change is the
semantic games approach of
Section 6.1
.
 In standard evaluation games, the initial model does not change.
Modalities for model change, however, require a process of formula
evaluation where the model of evaluation changes as, say, witnesses
for quantifiers are not replaced (unlike in standard semantics for
first-order logic), or moves change facts by causing damage to
accessibility relations. In other contexts, similar modalities are
justified by physical measurements that change the phenomenon under
investigation, (Hintikka 2002; Renardel 2001;
Ågotnes & Wáng 2017), while another natural
example are the dynamic-epistemic logics for information update
mentioned in the discussion of game play (Baltag & Renne 2016). Such generalized form of semantics
are of independent logical interest.
Example
Knowledge Games.
New logical games also arise naturally within the dynamics of
information, knowledge or belief as triggered by the process of game
play (cf.
Section 4
).
 In particular, information update suggests conversation games between
participants with similar or different goals. These games may be
cooperative, with players aiming to pool their information, thereby
turning distributed knowledge into common knowledge (Meyer
& van der Hoek 1995). But they can
also be competitive, say, when players strive to be the first to know
whether some relevant proposition holds. Mixtures between both modes
also occur, for instance with some players aiming to communicate a
fact that outsiders should not learn about (van
Ditmarsch 2003).
A concrete example are the ‘announcement games’ of Ågotnes
and van Ditmarsch (2011).
Players speak simultaneously and only once, while pursuing goal that
are specified as epistemic formulas. Speaking is modeled by public
announcement, and players preferences are binary. They prefer final
models where their goal formula holds over those where it is
false.
These games are conducted under imperfect information, as players may
not know the true state of their epistemic model. Accordingly, the
relevant strategies need to be uniform. Players must say the same
thing in all states they cannot distinguish. In general, then, many
solution concepts produce mixed strategy outcomes. In fact, it can be
shown that there exists simple announcement games without any unique
equilibrium in pure strategies. However, there is a relevant role for
logic to play. Suppose that the goal statements are all
‘universal’, i.e., constructed from literals by applying
only conjunction, disjunction, knowledge operators, and dynamic
modalities with universal announcements. Truth of such formulas is
preserved when transitioning from a model to a submodel. Consequently,
epistemic uncertainty becomes less harmful and knowledge games with
universal goals have equilibria in pure strategies. Recently,
knowledge games have been expanded further to include both questions
and answers as separate actions of issue change and information change
(Ågotnes, van Benthem et al.
2012).
Example
Boolean games.
A third example of game design in between game logics and logic games
are the Boolean games of Harrenstein et al.
(2001) and Gutierrez, Harrenstein, and
Wooldridge (2015) that have been mentioned several times
already. Each player is handed control over a subset of the
propositional variables, and can pick truth values for these at will.
Using goals specified in temporal logics, these games can model a
large number of relevant scenarios of agency. By now, a growing body
of work addresses various aspects of Boolean games including their
computational characteristics (both single-shot and iterated), their
game-theoretic properties and equilibria (Gutierrez,
Harrenstein, & Wooldridge
2015), and their connections with games played on social
networks (Seligman & Thompson 2015).
Further discussion can be found in the entry on
coalitional powers
.
6.3 Special Topics
Back and forth between game logics and logic games
The topic of this section suggests cycles between the two perspectives
on logic and games. Given a logical system, one can design logical
games for it, which can then again be studied using some appropriate
game logic. Conversely, given a game, one can introduce a logic for
describing it, and then introduce evaluation games for that logic, and
so on. Sometimes these cycles reach fixed-points, where, say, the
evaluation game for a formula describing some game is isomorphic to
that game itself. But sometimes, the cycling continues. For
discussion, see Rebuschi (2006) and van Benthem
(2014).
Imperfect information
Logic games naturally support
imperfect information, where players do not have complete access to
what their opponents do. Epistemic variations can have far-reaching
consequences for the corresponding logics. A particularly prominent
framework among this lines is the
independence friendly logic
of Hintikka and Sandu (1989), see also
Hintikka and Sandu (1997) and Mann, Sandu, and
Sevenster (2011).
Argumentation games and graph games
Another strand of
game analysis with a connection to logic is the study of argumentation
networks (Dung 1995; Caminada & Gabbay
2009), with uses in AI and philosophy (Grossi
2013; Shi 2018)
Computational logic
The material in this section is
closely connected to games in computational logic, which serve to
analyze expressive power of languages. For relevant results and
connections with automata theory, see Grädel,
Thomas, and Wilke (2002) and
van Benthem (2014).
Gaming and mechanism design
Game design is a
well-known aspect in the area of gaming (Rouse
2000). Likewise, mechanism design is an established topic in
game theory (Nisan & Ronen 2001; Osborne
& Rubinstein 1994). For connections between between logic,
game design and planning, see (Löwe,
Pacuit, & Witzel 2011; Löwe 2008).
7. Discussion and Further Directions
This entry presents an overview of current work at the interface of
logic and games. The topics surveyed fall in a number of strands
including current logical analysis of games in the broadest sense,
contacts between logic and classical game theory, connections with
probability and with computation, and, lastly, the game-theoretic
content of logic itself.
All this produced a perhaps bewildering variety of logical systems at
the interface with games. Yet, this entry also shows a certain unity
in approach, since the same sort of (modal) logics turn out suitable
to deal with quite different aspects of game structure and game play.
Moreover, when we step back a little, broader perspectives across the
specific systems surveyed here arise.
One noteworthy phenomenon is the existence of two different styles of
logical analysis. Some logical systems ‘zoom in’ on
particular aspects of an activity or reasoning practice, providing
more detail than what is usually found in standard mathematical or
philosophical analysis. Other logical systems do the opposite, and
‘zoom out’ to general patterns that may not have been
visible at the more detailed level of the original practice.
Most of the logical systems in this entry are of the fine-grained
‘zooming-in’ variety. Even so, coarse-grained logics of
the ‘zooming-out’ variety are interesting, too, as they
may highlight laws or general patterns in social behavior that lie
beyond the details attended to by games and game theory. One example
is the current interest in logics for the abstract notion of
dependence (Väänänen 2007;
Baltag 2016). Many forms of dependence and independence
permeate social life. Baltag and van Benthem
(2021) present a simple modal base logic of functional
dependence and independence which fits this perspective, suggesting an
analysis of strategies in extensive games as dynamic devices that
create dependencies among players. Chen, Shi & Wang (2022, Other
Internet Resources) then combine this framework, applied to strategic
games, with the modal preference logic discussed above to find a
common logical structure underlying both competitive and cooperative
games. Another example of the logical search for generality in games
is the proof-theoretic analysis of Hu and
Kaneko (2012) of the general postulates for social interaction
in Johansen (1982).
The interface area of logic and games still is
in statu
nascendi
. Correspondingly, there are obvious gaps and desiderata
on the logic side, which are reflected in the material in this
entry.
In particular, one fundamental theme are syntactic perspectives on
game-theoretic reasoning. Samples of a proof-theoretic style of
analysis for play can be found in de Bruin
(2005). More concretely, Zvesper
(2010) analyzes classical results in epistemic game theory,
(cf. Tan & Werlang 1988; Aumann
1999), in terms of abstract modalities for belief and
optimality, showing how a few simple proof rules from modal
μ-calculus can capture the essence of famous results in epistemic
game theory. Proof-theoretic aspects of logic have so far been
overshadowed by semantic analyses, although this situation is changing
slowly (Artemov 2014; Kaneko 2002; Kaneko &
Suzuki 2003). Model-based reasoning provides abstract semantic
perspectives on games that can aid conceptual clarification, and the
discovery of general laws. But it might turn out to be proof theory
that governs the concrete reasoning used in the semantics, and that
may be able to guide the context of justification in establishing
general facts about games.
A further contact with logic that has been ignored in this entry is
the rich interface between games and descriptive set theory (Woodin
2010; Kanamori 2003).
It should be stressed once more that logic is not the only formal
discipline that throws light on games. Quantitative probability enters
the study of games in many ways, both in classical and in evolutionary
game theory. The interface of logic and games may well profit from the
many old and new contacts between logic and probability (Leitgeb
2017; Lin & Kelly 2012;
Harrison-Trainor, Holliday, & Icard 2016).
Another link that remained underrepresented in this entry are
computational aspects. The study of games, play and players has
natural connections with computation and agency in computer science
and AI (Grädel, Thomas, & Wilke 2002;
Abramsky 2008; Halpern 2013; Perea 2012; Brandenburger 2014).
The proper perspective on what has been presented here may well turn
out to be a triangle of interfaces between logic, games, and
computation.
As for still broader connections, we have not done justice to all
links between logic, games and philosophy, of which more are found in
Stalnaker (1996, 1999). The same is true
for links to linguistics and psychology (Clark
2012). In this language-oriented connection, one should also
mention the work of Bjorndahl, Halpern, and
Pass (2017) on the natural language used in specifying games
and reasoning about them, thus making game analysis more
description-dependent.
Finally, the main thrust of this entry is theoretical and
foundational. However, there also is a more practical aspect to logic
and games. Logic plays a role in cognitive psychology and experimental
game theory, if only to identify testable hypotheses related to Theory
of Mind or strategic reasoning (Ghosh,
Meijering, & Verbrugge 2014; Ghosh & Verbrugge 2018; Bicchieri
1993; Fagin, Halpern et al. 1995). Lastly, some work at the
interface of logic and games suggests outreach to the world of actual
parlor games (van Ditmarsch & Kooi 2015;
van Benthem & Liu 2019).
All in all, the claim of this entry is a modest one. Logic and games
form a natural combination, that may reveal interesting things when
pursued explicitly. Even so, too much logic may import too much of a
formal apparatus, which may end up strangling the games perspective:
logical systems are infinite machineries that can easily overwhelm a
concrete game of interest. In short, the contact has to be managed
with care.

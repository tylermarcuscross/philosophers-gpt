Aristotelianism in the Renaissance
First published Wed Nov 16, 2005; substantive revision Wed Feb 28, 2018
“Renaissance” is used as a useful short label for the
period ca. 1348 to ca. 1648. But the use of the term
“Aristotelianism” as applied to texts, contents and
contexts of that period is
 problematic.
[
1
]
Some authors did indeed consider themselves as part of a
“peripatetic” (i.e., Aristotelian) current or
 school,
[
2
]
but it would be counterintuitive to limit the application of the term
“Aristotelianism” only to those authors of whom such
statements are known (since it probably would exclude most Renaissance
commentators on Aristotle).
[
3
]
On the other hand, if we use the term
“Aristotelianism” to denote everything in Renaissance
philosophy that with some high degree of probability makes direct or
indirect use of Aristotle’s texts: this would mean that
“Aristotelianism in the Renaissance” and “Philosophy
in the Renaissance” are equivalent terms (cf. Keßler
1990).
However, there are texts in Renaissance philosophy that are obviously
more “Aristotelian” than others, namely, the
commentaries
on texts by Aristotle.  There are more of them
than we have from any other period of the history of philosophy. And
in many of the Renaissance universities philosophy training
was keyed to the interpretation of texts by Aristotle and often
involved the use of textbooks derived from works by Aristotle and his
commentators. In addition to this, the
corpus Aristotelicum
was used as a matrix for textbooks and encyclopedias and as a
starting point for treatises on more or less special philosophical
 questions.

1. Commentaries on Texts from the
Corpus Aristotelicum
In no other period of the history of philosophy, as far as we know,
have so many commentaries on works by Aristotle been written (both per
year and in total) as in the
 Renaissance.
[
5
]
Even on the incomplete basis of Lohr’s first version of his catalogue
of Renaissance Latin Aristotle
 Commentaries
[
6
]
Richard Blum has counted 6653 such commentaries for the period
1500 to
 1650.
[
7
]
The magnitude of this number should be considered
significant—especially in comparison to the ca. 750
commentaries listed for the
fifteenth
century in Lohr’s
catalogue of “mediaeval” Aristotle
 commentaries.
[
8
]
The real reasons of this increase of interest are yet
unknown. However, the reasons might include:
the rising number of universities (probably connected with a
rising number of persons in charge of expounding works of Aristotle to
their students),
enhanced access to existing scholarship on Aristotle and the
corpus aristotelicum
by the advent of 
 printing
[
9
]
enhancement of propagation (and thus broader visibility) of
commentaries by the advent of
 printing
[
10
]
changes in the role of philosophy education at universities
and a resulting need for new commentaries,
advances and new trends in Aristotle scholarship (including strong
reception of the Greek Aristotle commentaries!), and the need to react
to them,
impact of texts from outside the Aristotelian tradition,
reaction to extra-philosophical problems and phenomena.
It is possible to name Renaissance Aristotle commentaries influenced
by one or more of each of these. As a whole, the reasons given above
contribute to the great variety of what can be found in Renaissance
Aristotle
 commentaries
[
11
]
.
 It may even be that such delightful variety is what chiefly attracts
current scholars to studying this
genre
of philosophical
literature. And yet most of these commentaries have not yet been
studied by anyone since the 
 Renaissance.
[
12
]
There have been some attempts to sort Renaissance Aristotle
commentators into groups according to their use of or degree of
adherence to pre-Renaissance Aristotle commentaries (e.g.,
“Averroist”, “Alexandrist”,
“Thomist” schools/groups/traditions). However, it is
doubtful that such a sorting contributes to a better understanding of
their texts and contexts.  This is because many authors of Aristotle
commentaries—including some who had a particular preference
for one or more of the earlier commentators—used the earlier
commentaries on a case by case basis.
As far as we know, most of these commentaries were written for use in
a university setting (see below). As a consequence, the choice of
texts commented upon and the degree of detail given to a certain
passage is often due, at least in part, to its use in a classroom, a
universitarian debate or its relevance for exams.
There are no sharp borderlines between commentaries proper, textbooks,
encyclopedias, and treatises. (Philipp Melanchthon’s works on ethics
might be a good illustration of this: “Melanchthon on
Ethics” starts as something which is a commentary on parts of
the
Nicomachean Ethics
[Melanchthon, 1535] and—in the
1550 and later versions, now edited and translated by Günter Frank—was 
developed into something which is a textbook in which rather few
traces of and similarities to the commentary genre are left
[Melanchthon, 2008].)  And even where the work in question is a
commentary in the most narrow sense of the word, the text can be some
sort of
bibliographie raisonée
of the previous
literature (e.g., some of Augustinus Niphus’s texts), a decent guide
to some probable meaning of Aristotle’s text (e.g., some of Cesare
Cremonini’s commentaries on the
Parva naturalia
), or a text
written in order to influence the political world of the day (e.g.,
Antonio Montecatini’s commentary on the third book of Aristotle’s
politics [Montecatini, 1597]), or anything in-between.
Although most of the commentaries apparently deal with those texts
from the
corpus aristotelicum
that have been the focus of
interest from the 13th century to today, the Renaissance is a period
where the percentage of commentaries and other texts dealing with the works of Aristotle less frequently read today (e.g., the
Problemata,
the
Parva naturalia
) is higher than
one might expect.
2. Philosophy at Renaissance Universities
Although there seems to be no simple answer to the question of which
Renaissance institutions of “higher education” should be
considered as
 “universities”;
[
13
]
there is neither doubt nor conflict about the fact, that there were
many universities, and that many of them were founded in the
 Renaissance.
[
14
]
And at virtually all of them much of the philosophy taught there was
directly or indirectly founded on parts of the
corpus
aristotelicum
. And, given the wide range of texts (commentaries,
treatises, textbooks, collections of theses for disputations …)
making use of that
corpus
and being related directly or
indirectly to some sort of “universitarian” context and/or
use, and the fact that the overwhelming majority of the texts this
entry is about are texts related directly or indirectly to some sort
of such context and/or use, perhaps “Renaissance University
Texts in Philosophy” might be an even better description for
what this entry is about than its real title “Aristotelianism in
the Renaissance”.
In general, only some of the fields covered by the
corpus
aristotelicum
were part of any single university curriculum. We
do not yet have a survey on what was taught where and when, so we
cannot yet give a complete
 assessment,
[
15
]
but permitting some margin of error, we can say:
Logic
was taught everywhere (in some cases with a special
stress on the Prior Analytics material and in some cases with special
stress on the Posterior Analytics material, and in some cases with a
special stress on Topics and argumentation, and in later times—perhaps starting with Antonius Rubius
[
16
]
—also on the Categories).
Philosophy of nature
was widely taught: more intensively
in universities where philosophy students tended to pursue a medical
degree (e.g., in Bologna and Padua) and less intensively in
universities where philosophy students were trained for going on with
theology (e.g., many Protestant universities and the institutions of
higher education run by religious orders). Apparently the material
taught most prominently was what can be found in
De anima
II
and III and
Physics
, rather prominently what can be found in
De cœlo
and
Meteora
, and only rather rarely what can be found in the rest
of the
libri naturales
.
Metaphysics
was sometimes a niche subject without any
relevance for the regular degree examinations (e.g., in Padua),
sometimes of utmost importance (as in some Protestant cases), and
sometimes somewhere in-between (e.g., in Ingolstadt).
The stress laid on
moral philosophy
differed
considerably, and generally ethics was far more prominent than
politics—let alone
 economics.
[
17
]
It seems difficult (or even impossible) to find a single statement on
which
all
known Renaissance “Aristotelians”
agree. This may be due, in part, to the specialization of teachers
(Melanchthon not agreeing that all knowledge rises from the senses,
Cremonini disinterested in moral philosophy and thus not making
statements on virtues, …).
There are a few explicit statements of the reasons for basing the
teaching of philosophy at universities on the
corpus
aristotelicum
or works derived from it. Augustinus Niphus (died
1538)—who probably gave the fullest treatment of this
question—gives the following
 reasons (Niphus, 1544, f. †††† 2vb): 
 The parts of philosophy are treated by Aristotle one by one in books
each of which is dedicated to just one part of philosophy; he proceeds
from what is better known to us to that which is less known to us; he
finds out about things by discussing views held by others; he treats
everything with apt ampleness and conciseness; his style is that of a
philosopher and not that of an orator; he is consistent.
Philipp Melanchthon states, in his 1536 oration “On
Philosophy” (Melanchthon, 1843), that you have to choose a
genre
of philosophy which is not sophistic, and which adheres
to the correct method, and that the one taught by Aristotle is such a
 philosophy.
[
18
]
(He then continues to reject stoic, epicurean and platonic
alternatives … .)
Note that neither Niphus nor Melanchthon claim that a reason for using
the
corpus aristotelicum
as the basis of teaching philosophy
at universities is the
truth
of any of Aristotle’s
 statements.
[
19
]
Melanchthon goes on to request that, in addition to Aristotle, other
authors should be used for some fields, something that is admitted
also by
 Niphus.
[
20
]
Philosophy taught at Renaissance universities uses Aristotle as its
main starting point and main basis, but (at least in many cases)
Aristotle (together with his commentators) is not the only basis of
philosophy taught at Renaissance
 universities.
[
21
]
Interest in Renaissance university philosophy has been rekindled by
Ernest Renan who investigated several philosophers teaching at Padua
(Renan, 1866), and “Paduan” Renaissance university
philosophy is the part of “Renaissance Aristotelianism”
that has been most thoroughly studied. But as research progresses and
more knowledge is gained about more universities and authors, the
image gets more complex and less apt for generalizations. This adds
insight into the diversity of the traditions at each university and
the diversity of philosophies taught by teachers at each 
 one.
[
22
]
These teachers are probably best studied as single philosophers, and
not as mere adherents or members of some
 school.
[
23
]
3. Textbooks and Encyclopedias
Textbooks and encyclopedias are not necessarily contrasting
genres
, as sometimes encyclopedias were used as textbooks. In
spite of being (again) based on Aristotle (and his commentators), some
textbooks did provide more “untraditional” views by
integrating material found in Aristotle (and his commentators) with
material found in other
 authors.
[
24
]
Other textbooks provided untraditional views by their choice of what
they retained and what they left out and how they paraphrased what
they
 retained.
[
25
]
Although these textbooks are not proper ‘commentaries’ on
the works of Aristotle, in some cases they provide sensible
interpretation of statements by Aristotle beyond many
  commentaries.
[
26
]
Schmitt’s “The rise of the philosophical textbook” (1988)
remains the definitive text to read on philosophical textbooks in the
Renaissance.
4. Treatises etc.
Commentaries and textbooks are not the only types of texts used for
interpreting, discussing, defending, adapting and transforming the
doctrines of Aristotle (and his commentators) in the
Renaissance. Specialized treatises cover a wide range of subjects:
on the immortality of the soul, on innate heat, on the agent sense,
on the
regressus
, on vapour, on rhetoric imitation,
….  These treatises often treat a certain subject more or
less for its own sake, and not just in order to find out what was
Aristotle’s opinion on it—though the author will often settle
for a position that he believes to be the position of Aristotle.
Many printed collections of theses (for doctoral dissertations or
other purposes) can also be considered as specialized monographs
— though in the form we have them most of them do not provide us
with the argumentations that lead to the assumptions made.
Francisco Patrizi’s
Discussiones peripateticæ
(Patrizi, 1581), although not a pro-Aristotelian text, is one of the
most learned works on the subject of Aristotle and the Aristotelian
traditions we have from the Renaissance.  And it does not easily
fit into any of the sections used here.
5. Some Remarks on the History of the Habit of Sorting Renaissance Philosophy into Schools
The ancient habit of sorting philosophers into schools or groups seems
first to have been applied to Aristotelian philosophers by Francisco
 Patrizi [Franciscus Patritius]
[
27
]
in his
Discussiones peripateticæ
. It is an approach,
that is useful to give order to a text that treats a great number of
Renaissance
 Aristotelians.
[
28
]
But in a text not trying to give at least superficial doxographical
information concerning the single philosophers and their works, it
might (correctly) be interpreted as a pretext not to study these
philosophers and their
 works.
[
29
]
And the charming character of Renaissance “Aristotelian” texts
is more situated in their (considerable) diversities than in their
(limited) similarities.

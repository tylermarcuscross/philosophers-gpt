Common Knowledge
First published Tue Aug 28, 2001; substantive revision Fri Aug 5, 2022
A proposition \(A\) is
mutual knowledge
among a set of agents
if each agent knows that \(A\). Mutual knowledge by itself implies
nothing about what, if any, knowledge anyone attributes to anyone
else. Suppose each student arrives for a class meeting knowing that
the instructor will be late. That the instructor will be late is
mutual knowledge, but each student might think only she knows the
instructor will be late. However, if one of the students says openly
“Peter told me he will be late again,” then each student
knows that each student knows that the instructor will be late, each
student knows that each student knows that each student knows that the
instructor will be late, and so on,
ad infinitum.
The
announcement made the mutually known fact
common knowledge
among the students.
Common knowledge is a phenomenon which underwrites much of social
life. In order to communicate or otherwise coordinate their behavior
successfully, individuals typically require mutual or common
understandings or background knowledge. Indeed, if a particular
interaction results in “failure”, the usual explanation
for this is that the agents involved did not have the common knowledge
that would have resulted in success. If a married couple are separated
in a department store, they stand a good chance of finding one another
because their common knowledge of each others’ tastes and
experiences leads them each to look for the other in a part of the
store both know that both would tend to frequent. Since the spouses
both love cappuccino, each expects the other to go to the coffee bar,
and they find one another. But in a less happy case, if a pedestrian
causes a minor traffic jam by crossing against a red light, she
explains her mistake as the result of her not noticing, and therefore
not knowing, the status of the traffic signal that all the motorists
knew. The spouses coordinate successfully given their common
knowledge, while the pedestrian and the motorists miscoordinate as the
result of a breakdown in common knowledge.
Given the importance of common knowledge in social interactions, it is
remarkable that only quite recently have philosophers and social
scientists attempted to analyze the concept. David Hume (1740) was
perhaps the first to make explicit reference to the role of mutual
knowledge in coordination. In his account of convention in
A
Treatise of Human Nature
, Hume argued that a necessary condition
for coordinated activity was that agents all know what behavior to
expect from one another. Without the requisite mutual knowledge, Hume
maintained, mutually beneficial social conventions would disappear.
Much later, J. E. Littlewood (1953) presented some examples of
common-knowledge-type reasoning, and Thomas Schelling (1960) and John
Harsanyi (1967–1968) argued that something like common knowledge
is needed to explain certain inferences people make about each other.
The philosopher Robert Nozick describes, but does not develop, the
notion in his doctoral dissertation (Nozick 1963), while the first
mathematical analysis and application of the notion of common
knowledge is found in the technical report by Friedell (1967), then
published as (Friedell
 1969).
[

The first full-fledged philosophical analysis of common knowledge was
offered by David Lewis (1969) in the monograph
Convention.
Stephen Schiffer (1972), Robert Aumann (1976), and Gilbert Harman
(1977) independently gave alternate definitions of common knowledge.
Jon Barwise (1988, 1989) gave a precise formulation of Harman’s
intuitive account. Throughout the 1980s a number of epistemic
logicians, both from philosophy and from computer science, studied the
logical structure of common knowledge, and the interested reader
should consult the relevant portions of the two important monographs
(Fagin et al. 1995) and (Meyer and Van der Hoek 1995). Margaret
Gilbert (1989) proposed a somewhat different account of common
knowledge which she argues is preferable to the standard account.
Others have developed accounts of mutual knowledge,
approximate
common knowledge
, and
common belief
which require less
stringent assumptions than the standard account, and which serve as
more plausible models of what agents know in cases where strict common
knowledge seems impossible (Brandenburger and Dekel 1987,
 Monderer and Samet 1989, Rubinstein 1992). The analysis and
applications of common knowledge and related multi-agent knowledge
concepts has become a lively field of research.
The purpose of this essay is to overview of some of the most important
results stemming from this contemporary research. The topics reviewed
in each section of this essay are as follows: Section 1 gives
motivating examples which illustrate a variety of ways in which the
actions of agents depend crucially upon their having, or lacking,
certain common knowledge. Section 2 discusses alternative analyses of
common knowledge. Section 3 reviews applications of multi-agent
knowledge concepts, particularly to
game theory
(von Neumann
and Morgenstern 1944), in which common knowledge assumptions have been
found to have great importance in justifying
solution
concepts
for mathematical games. Section 4 discusses skeptical
doubts about the attainability of common knowledge. Finally, Section 5
discusses the
common belief
concept which result from
weakening the assumptions of Lewis’ account of common
knowledge.

1. Motivating Examples
Most of the examples in this section are familiar in the common
knowledge literature, although some of the details and interpretations
presented here are new. Readers may want to ask themselves what, if
any, distinctive aspects of mutual and common knowledge reasoning each
example illustrates.
1.1. The Clumsy Waiter
A waiter serving dinner slips, and spills gravy on a guest’s
white silk evening gown. The guest glares at the waiter, and the
waiter declares “I’m sorry. It was my fault.” Why
did the waiter say that he was at fault? He knew that he was at fault,
and he knew from the guest’s angry expression that she knew he
was at fault. However, the sorry waiter wanted assurance that the
guest
knew that he knew
he was at fault. By saying openly
that he was at fault, the waiter knew that the guest knew what he
wanted her to know, namely, that he knew he was at fault. Note that
the waiter’s declaration established at least three levels of
nested
 knowledge.
[
2
]
Certain assumptions are implicit in the preceding story. In
particular, the waiter must know that the guest knows he has spoken
the truth, and that she can draw the desired conclusion from what he
says in this context. More fundamentally, the waiter must know that if
he announces “It was my fault” to the guest, she will
interpret his intended meaning correctly and will infer what his
making this announcement ordinarily implies in this context. This in
turn implies that the guest must know that if the waiter announces
“It was my fault” in this context, then the waiter indeed
knows he is at fault. Then on account of his announcement, the waiter
knows that the guest knows that he knows he was at fault. The
waiter’s announcement was meant to generate
higher-order
levels of knowledge of a fact each already
knew.
Just a slight strengthening of the stated assumptions results in even
higher levels of nested knowledge. Suppose the waiter and the guest
each know that the other can infer what he infers from the
waiter’s announcement. Can the guest now believe that the waiter
does not know that she knows that he knows he is at fault? If the
guest considers this question, she reasons that if the waiter falsely
believes it is possible that she does not know that he knows he is at
fault, then the waiter must believe it to be possible that she cannot
infer that he knows he is at fault from his own declaration. Since she
knows she
can
infer that the waiter knows he is at fault from
his declaration, she knows that the waiter knows she can infer this,
as well. Hence the waiter’s announcement establishes the
fourth-order knowledge claim: The guest knows that the waiter knows
that she knows that he knows he is at fault. By similar, albeit
lengthier, arguments, the agents can verify that corresponding
knowledge claims of even higher-order must also obtain under these
assumptions.
1.2 The Barbecue Problem
This is a variation of an example first published by Littlewood
(1953), although he notes that his version of the example was already
well-known at the
 time.
[

]
\(N\) individuals enjoy a picnic supper together which includes
barbecued spareribs. At the end of the meal, \(k \ge 1\) of these
diners have barbecue sauce on their faces. Since no one can see her
own face, none of the messy diners knows whether he or she is messy.
Then the cook who served the spareribs returns with a carton of ice
cream. Amused by what he sees, the cook rings the dinner bell and
makes the following announcement: “At least one of you has
barbecue sauce on her face. I will ring the dinner bell over and over,
until anyone who is messy has wiped her face. Then I will serve
dessert.” For the first \(k - 1\) rings, no one does anything.
Then, at the \(k\)
th
ring, each of the messy individuals
suddenly reaches for a napkin, and soon afterwards, the diners are all
enjoying their ice cream.
How did the messy diners finally realize that their faces needed
cleaning? The \(k = 1\) case is easy, since in this case, the lone
messy individual will realize he is messy immediately, since he sees
that everyone else is clean. Consider the \(k = 2\) case next. At the
first ring, messy individual \(i_1\) knows that one other person,
\(i_2\), is messy, but does not yet know about himself. At the second
ring, \(i_1\) realizes that he must be messy, since had \(i_2\) been
the only messy one, \(i_2\) would have known this after the first ring
when the cook made his announcement, and would have cleaned her face
then. By a symmetric argument, messy diner \(i_2\) also concludes that
she is messy at the second ring, and both pick up a napkin at that
time.
The general case follows by induction. Suppose that if \(k = j\), then
each of the \(j\) messy diners can determine that he is messy after
\(j\) rings. Then if \(k = j + 1\), then at the \(j + 1\)
st
ring, each of the \(j + 1\) individuals will realize that he is messy.
For if he were not messy, then the other \(j\) messy ones would have
all realized their messiness at the \(j\)
th
ring and
cleaned themselves then. Since no one cleaned herself after the
\(j\)
th
ring, at the \(j + 1\)
st
ring each messy
person will conclude that someone besides the other \(j\) messy people
must also be messy, namely, himself.
The “paradox” of this argument is that for \(k \gt 1\),
like the case of the clumsy waiter of Example 1.1, the cook’s
announcement told the diners something that each already knew. Yet
apparently the cook’s announcement also gave the diners useful
information. How could this be? By announcing a fact already known to
every diner, the cook made this fact
common knowledge
among
them, enabling each of them to eventually deduce the condition of his
own face after sufficiently many rings of the
 bell.

1.3 The Farmer’s Dilemma
Does meeting one’s obligations to others serve one’s
self-interest? Plato and his successors recognized that in certain
cases, the answer seems to be “No.” Hobbes (1651, pp.
101–102) considers the challenge of a “Foole”, who
claims that it is irrational to honor an agreement made with another
who has already fulfilled his part of the agreement. Noting that in
this situation one has gained all the benefit of the other’s
compliance, the Foole contends that it would now be best for him to
break the agreement, thereby saving himself the costs of compliance.
Of course, if the Foole’s analysis of the situation is correct,
then would the other party to the agreement not anticipate the
Foole’s response to agreements honored, and act accordingly?
Hume (1740, pp. 520–521) takes up this question, using an
example: Two neighboring farmers each expect a bumper crop of corn.
Each will require his neighbor’s help in harvesting his corn
when it ripens, or else a substantial portion will rot in the field.
Since their corn will ripen at different times, the two farmers can
ensure full harvests for themselves by helping each other when their
crops ripen, and both know this. Yet the farmers do not help each
other. For the farmer whose corn ripens later reasons that if she were
to help the other farmer, then when her corn ripens he would be in the
position of Hobbes’ Foole, having already benefited from her
help. He would no longer have anything to gain from her, so he would
not help her, sparing himself the hard labor of a second harvest.
Since she cannot expect the other farmer to return her aid when the
time comes, she will not help when his corn ripens first, and of
course the other farmer does not help her when her corn ripens
later.
The structure of Hume’s
Farmers’ Dilemma
problem
can be summarized using the following tree diagram:
Figure 1.1a
This tree is an example of a
game in extensive form.
At each
stage \(i\), the agent who moves can either choose \(C^i\), which
corresponds to helping or
cooperating
, or \(D^i\), which
corresponds to not helping or
defecting
. The relative
preferences of the two agents over the various outcomes are reflected
by the ordered pairs of
payoffs
each receives at any
particular outcome. If, for instance, Fiona chooses \(C^i\) and Alan
chooses \(D^i\), then Fiona’s payoff is 0, her worst payoff, and
Alan’s is 4, his best payoff. In a game such as the Figure 1.1.a
game, agents are
(Bayesian) rational
if each chooses an act
that maximizes her expected payoff, given what she knows.
In the Farmers’ Dilemma game, following the \(C^1,C^2\)-path is
strictly better for both farmers than following the \(D^1,D^2\)-path.
However, Fiona chooses \(D^1\), as the result of the following simple
argument: “If I were to choose \(C^1\), then Alan, who is
rational and who knows the payoff structure of the game, would choose
\(D^2\). I am also rational and know the payoff structure of the game.
So I should choose \(D^1\).” Since Fiona knows that Alan is
rational and knows the game’s payoffs, she concludes that she
need only analyze the
reduced
game in the following
figure:
Figure 1.1b
In this reduced game, Fiona is certain to gain a strictly higher
payoff by choosing \(D^1\) than if she chooses \(C^1\), so \(D^1\) is
her unique best choice. Of course, when Fiona chooses \(D^1\), Alan,
being rational, responds by choosing \(D^2\). If Fiona and Alan know:
(i) that they are both rational, (ii) that they both know the payoff
structure of the game, and (iii) that they both know (i) and (ii),
then they both can predict what the other will do at every node of the
Figure 1.1.a game, and conclude that they can rule out the
\(D^1,C^2\)-branch of the Figure 1.1.b game and analyze just the
reduced game of the following figure:
Figure 1.1c
On account of this
mutual knowledge
, both know that Fiona
will choose \(D^1\), and that Alan will respond with \(D^2\). Hence,
the \(D^1,D^2\)-outcome results if the Farmers’ Dilemma game is
played by agents having this mutual knowledge, though it is suboptimal
since both agents would fare better at the
 \(C^1,C^2\)-branch.
[

]
This argument, which in its essentials is Hume’s argument, is
an example of a standard technique for solving sequential games known
as
backwards
 induction.
[
6
]
The basic idea behind backwards induction is that the agents engaged
in a sequential game deduce how each will act throughout the entire
game by ruling out the acts that are not payoff-maximizing for the
agents who would move last, then ruling out the acts that are not
payoff-maximizing for the agents who would move next-to-last, and so
on. Clearly, backwards induction arguments rely crucially upon what,
if any, mutual knowledge the agents have regarding their situation,
and they typically require the agents to evaluate the truth values of
certain subjunctive conditionals, such as “If I (Fiona) were to
choose \(C^1\), then Alan would choose \(D^2\)”.
1.4 The Centipede
The mutual knowledge assumptions required to construct a backwards
induction solution to a game become more complex as the number of
stages in the game increases. To see this, consider the sequential
Centipede
game depicted in the following figure:
Figure 1.2
At each stage i\), the agent who moves can either choose \(R^i\),
which in the first three stages gives the other agent an opportunity
to move, or \(L^i\), which ends the game.
Like the Farmers’ Dilemma, this game is a commitment problem for
the agents. If each agent could trust the other to choose \(R^i\) at
each stage, then they would each expect to receive a payoff of 3.
However, Alan chooses \(L^1\), leaving each with a payoff of only 1,
as the result of the following backwards induction argument: “If
node \(n_4\) were to be reached, then Fiona, (being rational) would
choose \(L^4\). I, knowing this, would (being rational) choose \(L^3\)
if node \(n_3\) were to be reached. Fiona, knowing
this
,
would (being rational) choose \(L^2\) if node \(n_2\) were to be
reached. Hence, I (being rational) should choose \(L^1\).” To
carry out this backwards induction argument, Alan implicitly assumes
that: (i) he knows that Fiona knows he is rational, and (ii) he knows
that Fiona knows that he knows she is rational. Put another way, for
Alan to carry out the backwards induction argument, at node \(n_1\) he
must know what Fiona must know at node \(n_2\) to make \(L^2\) her
best response should \(n_2\) be reached. While in the Farmer’s
Dilemma Fiona needed only
first-order
knowledge of
Alan’s rationality and
second-order
knowledge of
Alan’s knowledge of the game to derive the backwards induction
solution, in the Figure 1.2 game, for Alan to be able to derive the
backwards induction solution, the agents must have
third-order
mutual knowledge
of the game and
second-order mutual
knowledge
of rationality, and Alan must have
fourth-order
knowledge of this mutual knowledge of the game
and
third-order
knowledge of their mutual knowledge of
rationality. This argument also involves several counterfactuals,
since to construct it the agents must be able to evaluate conditionals
of the form, “If node \(n_i\) were to be reached, Alan (Fiona)
would choose \(L^i (R^i)\)”, which for \(i \gt 1\) are
counterfactual, since third-order mutual knowledge of rationality
implies that nodes \(n_2,\) \(n_3\), and \(n_4\) are never
reached.
The method of backwards induction can be applied to any sequential
game of
perfect information
, in which the agents can observe
each others’ moves in turn and can recall the entire history of
play. However, as the number of potential stages of play increases,
the backwards induction argument evidently becomes harder to
construct. This raises certain questions: (1) What precisely are the
mutual or common knowledge assumptions that are required to justify
the backwards induction argument for a particular sequential game? (2)
As a sequential game increases in complexity, would we expect the
mutual knowledge that is required for backwards induction to start to
fail?
1.5 The Department Store
When a man loses his wife in a department store without any prior
understanding on where to meet if they get separated, the chances are
good that they will find each other. It is likely that each will think
of some obvious place to meet, so obvious that each will be sure that
it is “obvious” to both of them. One does not simply
predict where the other will go, which is wherever the first predicts
the second to predict the first to go, and so
ad infinitum.
Not “What would I do if I were she?” but “What would
I do if I were she wondering what she would do if she were wondering
what I would do if I were
she … ?”
—Thomas Schelling,
The Strategy of
Conflict
Schelling’s department store problem is an example of a
pure
coordination problem
, that is, an interaction problem in which
the interests of the agents coincide perfectly. Schelling (1960) and
Lewis (1969), who were the first to make explicit the role common
knowledge plays in social coordination, were also among the first to
argue that coordination problems can be modeled using the analytic
vocabulary of game theory. A very simple example of such a
coordination problem is given in the next figure:

\(s_i =\) search on floor \(i\), \(1 \leq i \leq 4\)
Figure 1.3
The matrix of Figure 1.3 is an example of a
game in strategic
form.
At each outcome of the game, which corresponds to a cell in
the matrix, the row (column) agent receives as payoff the first
(second) element of the ordered pair in the corresponding cell.
However, in strategic form games, each agent chooses without first
being able to observe the choices of any other agent, so that all must
choose as if they were choosing simultaneously. The Figure 1.3 game is
a game of
pure coordination
(Lewis 1969), that is, a game in
which at each outcome, each agent receives exactly the same payoff.
One interpretation of this game is that Schelling’s spouses, Liz
and Robert, are searching for each other in the department store with
four floors, and they find each other if they go to the same floor.
Four outcomes at which the spouses coordinate correspond to the
strategy profiles \((s_j, s_j), 1 \le j \le 4\), of the Figure 1.3
game. These four profiles are strict
Nash equilibria
(Nash
1950, 1951) of the game, that is, each agent has a decisive reason to
follow her end of one of these strategy profiles provided that the
other also follows this
 profile.
[
7
]
The difficulty the agents face is trying to select an equilibrium to
follow. For suppose that Robert hopes to coordinate with Liz on a
particular equilibrium of the game, say \((s_2, s_2)\). Robert reasons
as follows: “Since there are several strict equilibria we might
follow, I should follow my end of \((s_2, s_2)\) if, and only if, I
have sufficiently high expectations that Liz will follow her end of
\((s_2, s_2)\). But I can only have sufficiently high expectations
that Liz will follow \((s_2, s_2 )\) if she has sufficiently high
expectations that I will follow \((s_2, s_2)\). For her to have such
expectations, Liz must have sufficiently high (second-order)
expectations that I have sufficiently high expectations that she will
follow \((s_2, s_2)\), for if Liz doesn’t have these
(second-order) expectations, then she will believe I don’t have
sufficient reason to follow \((s_2, s_2)\) and may therefore deviate
from \((s_2, s_2)\) herself. So I need to have sufficiently high
(third-order) expectations that Liz has sufficiently high
(second-order) expectations that I have sufficiently high expectations
that she will follow \((s_2, s_2 )\), which involves her in
fourth-order expectations regarding me, which involves me in
fifth-order expectations regarding Liz, and so on.” What would
suffice for Robert, and Liz, to have decisive reason to follow \((s_2,
s_2)\) is that they each
know
that the other
knows
that … that the other will follow \((s_2, s_2)\) for any number
of levels of knowledge, which is to say that between Liz and Robert it
is common knowledge that they will follow \((s_2, s_2)\). If agents
follow a strict equilibrium in a pure coordination game as a
consequence of their having common knowledge of the game, their
rationality and their intentions to follow this equilibrium, and no
other, then the agents are said to be following a
Lewis-convention
(Lewis 1969).
Lewis’ theory of convention applies to a more general class of
games than pure coordination games, but pure coordination games
already model a variety of important social interactions. In
particular, Lewis models conventions of language as equilibrium points
of a pure coordination game. The role common knowledge plays in games
of pure coordination sketched above of course raises further
questions: (1) Can people ever attain the common knowledge which
characterizes a Lewis-convention? (2) Would less stringent epistemic
assumptions suffice to justify Nash equilibrium behavior in a
coordination problem?
2. Alternative Accounts of Common Knowledge
2.1 The Hierarchical Account
2.2 Lewis’ Account
2.3 Aumann’s Account
2.4 Barwise’s Account
2.5 Gilbert’s Account
Informally, a proposition \(A\) is
mutually known
among a set
of agents if each agent knows that \(A\). Mutual knowledge by itself
implies nothing about what, if any, knowledge anyone attributes to
anyone else. Suppose each student arrives for a class meeting knowing
that the instructor will be late. That the instructor will be late is
mutual knowledge, but each student might think only she knows the
instructor will be late. However, if one of the students says openly
“Peter told me he will be late again,” then the mutually
known fact is now
commonly known.
Each student now knows that
the instructor will be late, and so on,
ad infinitum.
The
agents have common knowledge in the sense articulated informally by
Schelling (1960), and more precisely by Lewis (1969) and Schiffer
(1972). Schiffer uses the formal vocabulary of
epistemic logic
(Hintikka 1962) to state his definition of common knowledge.
Schiffer’s general approach was to augment a system of
sentential logic with a set of knowledge operators corresponding to a
set of agents, and then to define common knowledge as a hierarchy of
propositions in the augmented system. Bacharach (1992) and Bicchieri
(1993) adopt this approach, and develop logical theories of common
knowledge which include soundness and completeness theorems in the
style of (Fagin et al. 1995). One can also develop formal accounts of
common knowledge in set-theoretic terms, as it was done in the early
Friedell (1969) and in the economic literature after Aumann (1976).
Such an approach, easily proven to be equivalent to the ones cast in
epistemic logic, is taken also in this
 article.

2.1 The Hierarchical Account
Monderer and Samet (1988) and Binmore and Brandenburger (1989) give a
particularly elegant set-theoretic definition of common knowledge. I
will review this definition here, and then show that it is logically
equivalent to the ‘\(i\) knows that \(j\) knows that \(\ldots
k\) knows that A’ hierarchy that Lewis (1969) and Schiffer
(1972) argue characterizes common
 knowledge.
[
9
]
Some preliminary notions must be stated first. Following C. I. Lewis
(1943–1944) and Carnap (1947), propositions are formally subsets
of a set \(\Omega\) of
state descriptions
or
possible
worlds.
One can think of the elements of \(\Omega\) as
representing Leibniz’s possible worlds or Wittgenstein’s
possible states of affairs. Some results in the common knowledge
literature presuppose that \(\Omega\) is of finite cardinality. If
this admittedly unrealistic assumption is needed in any context, this
will be explicitly stated in this essay, and otherwise one may assume
that \(\Omega\) may be either a finite or an infinite set. A
distinguished actual world \(\omega_{\alpha}\) is an element of
\(\Omega\). A proposition \(A \subseteq \Omega\) obtains (or is true)
if the actual world \(\omega_{\alpha} \in A\). In general, we say that
\(A\)
obtains at
a world \(\omega \in \Omega\) if \(\omega
\in A\). What an agent \(i\) knows about the possible worlds is stated
formally in terms of a
knowledge operator
\(\mathbf{K}_i\).
Given a proposition \(A \subseteq \Omega , \mathbf{K}_i (A)\) denotes
a new proposition, corresponding to the set of possible worlds at
which agent \(i\) knows that A obtains. \(\mathbf{K}_i (A)\) is read
as ‘\(i\) knows (that) \(A\) (is the case)’. The knowledge
operator \(\mathbf{K}_i\) satisfies certain axioms, including:
\[\begin{align}
\tag{K1} \mathbf{K}_i (A) &\subseteq A \\
\tag{K2} \Omega &\subseteq \mathbf{K}_i (\Omega) \\
\tag{K3} \mathbf{K}_i(\bigcap_k A_k) &= \bigcap_k \mathbf{K}_i (A_k) \\
\tag{K4} \mathbf{K}_i (A) &\subseteq \mathbf{K}_i\mathbf{K}_i(A) \\
\tag{K5} -\mathbf{K}_i (A) &\subseteq \mathbf{K}_i -\mathbf{K}_{i}(A)
\end{align}\]
In words, K1 says that if \(i\) knows \(A\), then \(A\) must be the
case. K2 says that \(i\) knows that some possible world in \(\Omega\)
occurs no matter which possible world \(\omega\) occurs.
 K3
[
10
]
says that \(i\) knows a conjunction if, and only if, \(i\) knows each
conjunct. K4 is a
reflection axiom
, sometimes also presented
as the
axiom of transparency
(or of
positive
introspection
), which says that if \(i\) knows \(A\), then \(i\)
knows that she knows \(A\). Finally, K5 says that if the agent does
not
know an event, then she knows that she does not know.
This axiom is presented as the axiom of
negative
introspection
, or as the
axiom of wisdom
(since the
agents possess Socratic wisdom, knowing that they do not know.) Note
that by K3, if \(A \subseteq B\) then \(\mathbf{K}_i (A) \subseteq
\mathbf{K}_i (B)\), by K1 and K2, \(\mathbf{K}_i (\Omega) = \Omega\),
and by K1 and K4, \(\mathbf{K}_i (A) = \mathbf{K}_i \mathbf{K}_i
(A)\). Any system of knowledge satisfying K1–K5 corresponds to
the modal system S5, while any system satisfying K1–K4
corresponds to S4 (Kripke 1963). If one drops the K1 axiom and retains
the others, the resulting system would give a formal account of what
an agent
believes
, but does not necessarily
know
.
A useful notion in the formal analysis of knowledge is that of a
possibility set.
An agent i’s possibility set at a
state of the world \(\Omega\) is the smallest set of possible worlds
that \(i\) thinks could be the case if \(\omega\) is the actual world.
More precisely,
Definition 2.1
Agent \(i\)’s
possibility set
\(\mathcal{H}_i
(\omega)\) at \(\omega \in \Omega\) is defined as
\[\mathcal{H}_i (\omega) \equiv \bigcap \{ E \mid \omega \in \mathbf{K}_i (E) \}\]
The collection of sets
\[\mathcal{H}_i = \bigcup_{\omega \in \Omega} \mathcal{H}_{i}(\omega)\]
is \(i\)’s
private information system
.
Since in words, \(\mathcal{H}_i (\omega)\) is the intersection of all
propositions which \(i\) knows at \(\omega , \mathcal{H}_i (\omega)\)
is the smallest proposition in \(\Omega\) that \(i\) knows at
\(\omega\). Put another way, \(\mathcal{H}_i (\omega)\) is the most
specific information that \(i\) has about the possible world
\(\omega\). The intuition behind assigning agents private information
systems is that while an agent \(i\) may not be able to perceive or
comprehend every last detail of the world in which \(i\) lives, \(i\)
does know certain facts about that world. The elements of
\(i\)’s information system represent what \(i\) knows
immediately at a possible world. We also have the following:
Proposition 2.2
\(\mathbf{K}_i (A) = \{ \omega \mid \mathcal{H}_i (\omega) \subseteq A
\}\)
In many formal analyses of knowledge in the literature, possibility
sets are taken as primitive and Proposition 2.2 is given as the
definition of knowledge. If one adopts this viewpoint, then the axioms
K1–K5 follow as consequences of the definition of knowledge. In
many applications, the agents’ possibility sets are assumed to
partition
[
11
]
the set, in which case \(\mathcal{H}_i\) is called i’s
private information partition
. Notice that if axioms
K1–K5 hold, then the possibility sets of each agent always
partition the state set, and vice versa.
To illustrate the idea of possibility sets, let us return to the
Barbecue Problem described in Example 1.2. Suppose there are three
diners: Cathy, Jennifer and Mark. Then there are 8 relevant states of
the world, summarized by Table 2.1:
Table 2.1
\(\omega_1\)
\(\omega_2\)
\(\omega_3\)
\(\omega_4\)
\(\omega_5\)
\(\omega_6\)
\(\omega_7\)
\(\omega_8\)

Each diner knows the condition of the other diners’ faces, but
not her own. Suppose the cook makes no announcement, after all. Then
none of the diners knows the true state of the world whatever \(\omega
\in \Omega\) the actual world turns out to be, but they do know
a
priori
that certain propositions are true at various states of
the world. For instance, Cathy’s information system before any
announcement is made is depicted in Figure 2.1a:
Figure 2.1a
In this case, Cathy’s information system is a partition
\(\mathcal{H}_1\) of \(\Omega\) defined by
\[
\mathcal{H}_1 = \{H_{CC}, H_{CM}, H_{MC}, H_{MM}\}
\]
where
\[\begin{align}
H_{CC} &= \{\omega_1, \omega_2\} \text{ (i.e., Jennifer and Mark are both clean)} \\
H_{CM} &= \{\omega_4, \omega_6\} \text{ (i.e., Jennifer is clean and Mark is messy)} \\
H_{MC} &= \{\omega_3, \omega_5\} \text{ (i.e., Jennifer is messy and Mark is clean)} \\
H_{MM} &= \{\omega_7, \omega_8\} \text{ (i.e., Jennifer and Mark are both messy)}
\end{align}\]
Cathy knows immediately which cell \(\mathcal{H}_1 (\omega)\) in her
partition is the case at any state of the world, but does not know
which is the true state at any \(\omega \in \Omega\).
If we add in the assumption stated in Example 1.2 that if there is at
least one messy diner, then the cook announces the fact, then
Cathy’s information partition is depicted by Figure 2.1b:
Figure 2.1b
In this case, Cathy’s information system is a partition
\(\mathcal{H}_1\) of \(\Omega\) defined by
\[
\mathcal{H}_1 = \{H_{CCC}, H_{MCC}, H_{CM}, H_{MC}, H_{MM}\}
\]
where
\[\begin{align}
H_{CCC} &= \{\omega_1\} &&\text{ (i.e., Jennifer, Mark, and I are all clean)} \\
H_{MCC} &= \{\omega_2\} &&\text{ (i.e., Jennifer and Mark are clean and I am messy)} \\
H_{CM} &=  \{\omega_4, \omega_6\} && \text{ (i.e., Jennifer is clean and Mark is messy)} \\
H_{MC} &= \{\omega_3, \omega_5\} &&\text{ (i.e., Jennifer is messy and Mark is clean)} \\
H_{MM} &= \{\omega_7, \omega_8\} &&\text{ (i.e., Jennifer and Mark are both messy)} 
\end{align}\]
In this case, Cathy’s information partition is a
refinement
of the partition she has when there is no
announcement, for in this case, then Cathy knows
a priori
that if \(\omega_1\) is the case there will be no announcement and
will know immediately that she is clean, and Cathy knows
a
priori
that if \(\omega_2\) is the case, then she will know
immediately from the cook’s announcement that she is messy.
Similarly, if the cook makes an announcement only if he sees at least
two messy diners, Cathy’s possibility set is the one represented
in fig. 2.1c:
Figure 2.1c
Cathy’s information partition is now defined by
\[
\mathcal{H}_1 = \{H_{CC}, H_{CMC}, H_{CCM}, H_{MMC}, H_{MCM}, H_{MM}\}
\]
where
\[\begin{align}
H_{CC} &= \{\omega_1, \omega_2\} &&\text{ (i.e., Jennifer and Mark are both clean)} \\
H_{CMC} &= \{\omega_3\} &&\text{ (i.e., Mark and I are clean, Jennifer is messy)} \\
H_{CCM} &= \{\omega_4\} &&\text{ (i.e., Jennifer and I are clean, Mark is messy)} \\
H_{CCM} &= \{\omega_5\} &&\text{ (i.e., Jennifer and I are messy, Mark is clean)} \\
H_{CCM} &= \{\omega_6\} &&\text{ (i.e., Mark and I are messy, Jennifer is clean)} \\
H_{MM} &= \{\omega_7, \omega_8\} &&\text{ (i.e., Jennifer and Mark are both messy)}
\end{align}\]
In this case, Cathy knows
a priori
that if \(\omega_3\)
obtains there will be no announcement, and similarly for \(\omega_4\).
Thus, she will be able to distinguish these states from \(\omega_5\)
and \(\omega_6\), respectively.
As mentioned earlier in this subsection, the assumption that
agents’ possibility sets partition the state space depends on
the modeler’s choice of specific axioms for the knowledge
operators. For example, if we drop axiom K5 (preserving the validity
of K1–K4) the agent’s possibility sets need not partition
the space set (follow the link for an
example
.
 For more details and applications, cf. Samet 1990.) It was
conjectured (cf. Geanakoplos 1989) that lack of negative introspection
(i.e. systems without K5) would allow to incorporate unforeseen
contingencies in the epistemic model, by representing the
agents’
unawareness
of certain events (i.e. the case in
which the agent does not know that an event occurs and also does not
know that she does not know that.) It was later shown by Dekel et al.
(1998) that standard models are not suitable to represent
agents’ unawareness. An original non-standard model to represent
unawareness is provided in Heifetz
et al
. (2006). For a
comprehensive bibliography on modeling unawareness and applications of
the notion, cf. the external links at the end on this entry.
We can now define mutual and common knowledge as follows:
Definition 2.3
Let a set \(\Omega\) of possible worlds together with a set of agents
\(N\) be given.
1. The proposition that \(A\) is
(first level
or
first
order)
mutual knowledge for the agents of
N,
\(\mathbf{K}^{1}_N (A)\), is the set defined by
\[
\mathbf{K}^1_N (A) \equiv \bigcap_{i\in N} \mathbf{K}_i(A).
\]
2. The proposition that \(A\) is \(m\)
th
level
(or
\(m\)
th
order
)
mutual knowledge among the
agents of N
, \(\mathbf{K}^m_N(A),\) is defined recursively as the
set
\[
\mathbf{K}^m_N(A) \equiv \bigcap_{i\in N} \mathbf{K}_i (\mathbf{K}^{m-1}_N(A)).
\]
3. The proposition that \(A\) is
common knowledge
among the
agents of \(N, \mathbf{K}^{*}_N (A),\) is defined as the
 set
[
12
]
\[
\mathbf{K}^*_N (A) \equiv \bigcap_{m=1}^{\infty} \mathbf{K}^m_N(A).
\]
Common knowledge of a proposition \(E\) implies common knowledge of
all that \(E\) implies, as is shown in the following:
Proposition 2.4
If \(\omega \in \mathbf{K}^{*}_N (E)\) and \(E \subseteq F\), then
\(\omega \in \mathbf{K}^{*}_N (F)\).
Proof
.
Note that \((\mathbf{K}^m_N(E))_{m\ge 1}\) is a decreasing sequence of
events, in the sense that \(\mathbf{K}^{m+1}_N (E) \subseteq
\mathbf{K}^m_N(E)\), for all \(m \ge 1\). It is also easy to check
that if everyone knows \(E\), then \(E\) must be true, that is,
\(\mathbf{K}^1_N (E) \subseteq E\). If \(\Omega\) is assumed to be
finite, then if \(E\) is common knowledge at \(\omega\), this implies
that there must be a finite \(m\) such that
\[
\mathbf{K}^m_N(E) = \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} \mathbf{K}^n_N(E).
\]
The following result relates the set-theoretic definition of common
knowledge to the hierarchy of ‘\(i\) knows that \(j\) knows that
… knows \(A\)’ statements.
Proposition 2.5
\(\omega \in \mathbf{K}^m_N(A)\) iff
(1) For all agents \(i_1, i_2 , \ldots ,i_m \in N, \omega \in
\mathbf{K}_{i_1}\mathbf{K}_{i_2} \ldots \mathbf{K}_{i_m}(A)\)
Hence, \(\omega \in \mathbf{K}^*_N (A)\) iff (1) is the case for each
\(m \ge 1\).
Proof
.
The condition that \(\omega \in \mathbf{K}_{i_1}\mathbf{K}_{i_2}
\ldots \mathbf{K}_{i_m}(A)\) for all \(m \ge 1\) and all \(i_1, i_2 ,
\ldots ,i_m \in N\) is Schiffer’s definition of common
knowledge, and is often used as the definition of common knowledge in
the literature.
2.2 Lewis’ Account
Lewis is credited with the idea of characterizing common knowledge as
a hierarchy of ‘\(i\) knows that \(j\) knows that … knows
that \(A\)’ propositions. However, Lewis is aware of the
difficulties that such an infinitary definition raises. A first
problem is whether it is possible to reduce the infinity inherent in
the hierarchical account into a workable finite definition. A second
problem is the issue that finite agents cannot entertain the infinite
amount of epistemic states which is necessary for common knowledge to
obtain. Lewis tackles both problems, but his presentation is informal.
Aumann is often credited with presenting the first finitary method of
generating the common knowledge hierarchy (Aumann 1976), even though
(Friedell 1969) in fact predates both Aumann’s and Lewis’s
work. Recently, Cubitt and Sugden (2003) have argued that
Aumann’s and Lewis’ accounts of common knowledge are
radically different and irreconcilable.
Although Lewis introduced the technical term ‘common
knowledge,’ his analysis is about belief, rather than knowledge.
Indeed, Lewis offers his solution to the second problem mentioned
above by introducing a distinction between
actual belief
and
reason to believe
. Reasons to believe are interpreted as
potential beliefs of agents, so that the infinite hierarchy of
epistemic states becomes harmless, consisting in an infinite number of
states of potential belief. The solution to the first problem is given
by providing a finite set of conditions that, if met, generate the
infinite series of reasons to believe. Such conditions taken together
represent Lewis’ official definition of common knowledge. Notice
that it would be more appropriate to speak of ‘common reason to
believe,’ or, at least, of ‘common belief.’ Lewis
himself later acknowledges that “[t]hat term [common knowledge]
was unfortunate, since there is no assurance that it will be
knowledge, or even that it will be true.” Cf. (Lewis 1978, p.
44, n.13) Disregarding the distinction between reasons to believe and
actual belief, we follow (Vanderschraaf 1998) to give the details of a
formal account of Lewis’s definition here, and show that
Lewis’ analysis does result in the common knowledge hierarchy
following from a finite set of axioms. It is however debatable whether
a possible worlds approach can properly render the subtleties of
Lewis’ characterization. Cubitt and Sugden (2003), for example,
abandon the possible worlds framework altogether and propose a
different formal interpretation of Lewis in which, among other
elements, the distinction between reasons to believe and actual belief
is taken into account. An attempt to reconcile the two positions can
be found in (Sillari 2005), where Lewis’ characterization is
formalized in a richer possible worlds semantic framework where the
distinction between reasons to believe and actual believe is
represented.
Lewis presents his account of common knowledge on pp. 52–57 of
Convention
. Lewis does not specify what account of knowledge
is needed for common knowledge. As it turns out, Lewis’ account
is satisfactory for any formal account of knowledge in which the
knowledge operators \(\mathbf{K}_i, i \in N\), satisfy K1, K2, and K3.
A crucial assumption in Lewis’ analysis of common knowledge is
that agents know they share the same “rationality, inductive
standards and background information” (Lewis 1969, p. 53) with
respect to a state of affairs \(A'\), that is, if an agent can draw
any conclusion from \(A'\), she knows that all can do likewise. This
idea is made precise in the following:
Definition 2.6
Given a set of agents \(N\) and a proposition \(A' \subseteq \Omega\),
the agents of \(N\) are
symmetric reasoners with respect to
\(A' (or A'\)
-symmetric reasoners
) iff, for each \(i, j \in
N\) and for any proposition \(E \subseteq \Omega\), if \(\mathbf{K}_i
(A') \subseteq \mathbf{K}_i (E)\) and \(\mathbf{K}_i (A') \subseteq
\mathbf{K}_i\mathbf{K}_j(A')\), then \(\mathbf{K}_i (A') \subseteq
 \mathbf{K}_i\mathbf{K}_j(E)\).
[
13
]
The definiens says that for each agent \(i\), if \(i\) can infer from
\(A'\) that \(E\) is the case and that everyone knows that \(A'\) is
the case, then \(i\) can also infer that everyone knows that \(E\) is
the case.
Definition 2.7
A proposition \(E\) is
Lewis-common knowledge at
\(\omega \in
\Omega\) among the agents of a set \(N = \{1, \ldots ,n\}\) iff there
is a proposition \(A\)* such that \(\omega \in A\)*, the agents of
\(N\) are \(A\)*-symmetric reasoners, and for every \(i \in N\),

\[\begin{align}
\tag{L1} &\omega \in \mathbf{K}_i (A^*) \\
\tag{L2} &\mathbf{K}_i(A*) \subseteq \mathbf{K}_i(\bigcap_{j\in N} \mathbf{K}_j(A^*)) \\
\tag{L3} &\mathbf{K}_i (A*) \subseteq \mathbf{K}_i (E)
\end{align}\]
\(A\)* is a
basis
for the agents’ common knowledge.
\(\mathbf{L}*_N (E)\) denotes the proposition defined by L1–L3
for a set \(N\) of \(A\)*-symmetric reasoners, so we can say that
\(E\) is Lewis-common knowledge for the agents of \(N\) iff \(\omega
\in \mathbf{L}*_N (E)\).
In words, L1 says that \(i\) knows \(A\)* at \(\omega\). L2 says that
if \(i\) knows that \(A\)* obtains, then \(i\) knows that everyone
knows that \(A\)* obtains. This axiom is meant to capture the idea
that common knowledge is based upon a proposition \(A\)* that is
publicly known
, as is the case when agents hear a public
announcement. If the agents’ knowledge is represented by
partitions, then a typical basis for the agents’ common
knowledge would be an element \(\mathcal{M}(\omega)\) in the
 meet
[
14
]
of their partitions. L3 says that \(i\) can infer from \(A\)* that
\(E\). Lewis’ definition implies the entire common knowledge
hierarchy, as is shown in the following result.
Proposition 2.8
\(\mathbf{L}*_N (E) \subseteq \mathbf{K}*_N (E)\), that is,
Lewis-common knowledge of \(E\) implies common knowledge of \(E\).
Proof
.
As mentioned above, it has recently come into question whether a
formal rendition of Lewis’ definition as the one given above
adequately represents all facets of Lewis’ approach. Cubitt and
Sugden (2003) argue that it does not, their critique hinging on a
feature of Lewis’ analysis that is lost in the possible worlds
framework, namely the 3-place relation of
indication
used by
Lewis. The definition of indication can be found at pp. 52–53 of
Convention
:
Definition 2.9
A state of affairs \(A\)
indicates
\(E\) to agent \(i\) \((A
\indi E)\) if and only if, if \(i\) had reason to believe that \(A\)
held, \(i\) would thereby have reason to believe that \(E\)
The wording of Lewis’ definition and the use he makes of the
indication relation in the definitory clauses for common knowledge,
suggest that Lewis is careful to distinguish indication and material
implication. Cubitt and Sugden (2003) incorporate such distinction in
their formal reconstruction. Paired with their interpretation of
“\(i\) has reason to believe \(x\)” as “\(x\) is
yielded by some logic of reasoning that \(i\) endorses,” we have
that, if \(A \indi x,\) then \(i\)’s reason to believe \(A\)
provides \(i\) with reason to believe \(x\) as well. Given that Lewis
does want to endow agents with deductive reasoning, (Cubitt and Sugden
2003) list the following axioms, claiming that they capture the
desired properties of indication. For all agents \(i, j,\) with
\(\mathbf{R}_i A\) standing for “agent \(i\) has reason to
believe A”, we have
\[\begin{align}
\tag{CS1} (\mathbf{R}_i A \wedge A \indi x) &\to \mathbf{R}_i x \\
\tag{CS2} (A \text{ entails } B) &\to A \indi B \\
\tag{CS3} (A \indi x \wedge A \indi y) &\to A \indi (x \wedge y) \\
\tag{CS4} (A \indi B \wedge B \indi x) &\to A \indi x \\
\tag{CS5} ((A \indi \mathbf{R}_j B) \wedge \mathbf{R}_i(B \indj x)) &\to A \indi \mathbf{R}_j x
\end{align}\]
The first axioms captures the intuition behind indication. It says
that if an agent has reason to believe that \(A\) holds, then, if
\(A\) indicates \(x\) to her, she has reason to believe \(x\) as well.
CS2 says that indication extends material implication. CS3 says that
if two propositions \(x\) and \(y\) are indicated to an agent by a
proposition \(A\), then \(A\) indicates to her also the conjunction of
\(x\) and \(y\). The next axiom states that indication is transitive.
CS5 says that if a proposition \(A\) indicates to \(i\) that agent
\(j\) has reason to believe \(B\), and \(i\) has reason to believe
that \(B\) indicates \(x\) to \(j\), then \(A\) indicates to \(i\)
also that \(j\) has reason to believe \(x\).
Armed with these axioms, it is possible to give the following
definition.
Definition 2.10
In any given population \(P\) a proposition \(A\) is a
reflexive
common indicator that x
if and only if, for all \(i, j \in P\)
and all propositions \(x, y,\) the following four conditions hold:
\[\begin{align}
\tag{RCI1} &A \to \mathbf{R}_i  A \\
\tag{RCI2} &A \indi \mathbf{R}_j A \\
\tag{RCI3} &A \indi x \\
\tag{RCI4} &A \indj y \to \mathbf{R}_i(A \indj y)
\end{align}\]
Clauses RCI1–RCI3 above render L1–L3 of definition 2.7
above in the formal language that underlies axioms CS1–CS5;
while RCI4 affirms (cf. definition 2.6 above) that agents are
symmetric reasoners, i.e. that if a proposition indicates another
proposition to a certain agent, then it does so to all agents in the
population.
The following proposition shows that RCI1–RCI4 are sufficient
conditions for ‘common reason to believe’ to arise:
Proposition 2.11
If \(A\) holds, and if \(A\) is a common reflexive indicator in the
population \(P\) that \(x\), then there is common reason to believe in
\(P\) that \(x\).
Proof
.
A group of (ideal)
faultless reasoners
who have common reason
to believe that \(p\), will achieve common belief in \(p\).
Is it possible to take formally in account the insights of
Lewis’ definition of common knowledge without abandoning the
possible world framework? (Sillari 2005) puts forth an attempt to give
a positive answer to that question by articulating in a possible world
semantics the distinction between actual belief and reason to believe.
As in (Cubitt and Sugden 2003), the basic epistemic operator
represents reasons to believe. The idea is then to impose an
awareness structure
over possible worlds, adopting the
framework first introduced by Fagin and Halpern (1988). Simply put, an
awareness structure associates to each agent, for every possible
world, a set of events of which the agent is said to be aware. An
agent entertains an actual belief that a certain event occurs if and
only if she has reason to believe that the event occurs
and
such event is in her awareness set at the world under consideration. A
different avenue to the formalization of Lewis’s account of
common knowledge is offered by Paternotte (2011), where the central
notion is probabilistic common belief (see section 5.2 below).
2.3 Aumann’s Account
Aumann (1976) gives a different characterization of common knowledge
which gives another simple algorithm for determining what information
is commonly known. Aumann’s original account assumes that the
each agent’s possibility set forms a private information
partition of the space \(\Omega\) of possible worlds. Aumann shows
that a proposition C is common knowledge if, and only if, C contains a
cell of the meet of the agents’ partitions. One way to compute
the meet \(\mathcal{M}\) of the partitions \(\mathcal{H}_i, i \in N\)
is to use the idea of “reachability”.
Definition 2.13
A state \(\omega ' \in \Omega\) is
reachable
from \(\omega
\in \Omega\) iff there exists a sequence
\[\omega =\omega_0, \omega_1, \omega_2 , \ldots ,\omega_m =\omega'\]
such that for each \(k \in \{0,1, \ldots ,m-1\}\), there exists an
agent \(i_k \in N\) such that \(\mathcal{H}_{i_{ k} }(\omega_k) =
\mathcal{H}_{i_{ k} }(\omega_{k+1})\).
In words, \(\omega '\) is reachable from \(\omega\) if there exists a
sequence or “chain” of states from \(\omega\) to \(\omega
'\) such that two consecutive states are in the same cell of some
agent’s information partition. To illustrate the idea of
reachability, let us return to the modified Barbecue Problem in which
Cathy, Jennifer and Mark receive no announcement. Their information
partitions are all depicted in Figure 2.1d:
Figure 2.1d
One can understand the importance of the notion of reachability in the
following way: If \(\omega '\) is reachable from \(\omega\), then if
\(\omega\) obtains then some agent can reason that some other agent
thinks that \(\omega '\) is possible. Looking at Figure 2.1d, if
\(\omega = \omega_1\) occurs, then Cathy (who knows only that
\(\{\omega_1, \omega_2\}\) has occurred) knows that Jennifer thinks
that \(\omega_5\) might have occurred (even though Cathy knows that
\(\omega_5\) did not occur). So Cathy cannot rule out the possibility
that Jennifer thinks that Mark thinks that that \(\omega_8\) might
have occurred. And Cathy cannot rule out the possibility that Jennifer
thinks that Mark thinks that Cathy believes that \(\omega_7\) is
possible. In this sense, \(\omega_7\) is reachable from \(\omega_1\).
The chain of states which establishes this is \(\omega_1, \omega_2,
\omega_5, \omega_8, \omega_7\), since \(\mathcal{H}_1 (\omega_1) =
\mathcal{H}_1 (\omega_2),\) \(\mathcal{H}_2 (\omega_2) = \mathcal{H}_2
(\omega_5),\) \(\mathcal{H}_3 (\omega_5) = \mathcal{H}_3 (\omega_8),\)
and \(\mathcal{H}_1 (\omega_8) = \mathcal{H}_1 (\omega_7)\). Note that
one can show similarly that in this example any state is reachable
from any other state. This example also illustrates the following
immediate result:
Proposition 2.14
\(\omega'\) is reachable from \(\omega\) iff there is a sequence
\(i_1, i_2 , \ldots ,i_m \in N\) such that
\[
 \omega' \in \mathcal{H}_{i_m}(\cdots(\mathcal{H}_{i_2}(\mathcal{H}_{i_1}(\omega))))
\]
One can read (1) as: ‘At \(\omega , i_1\) thinks that \(i_2\)
thinks that \(\ldots ,i_m\) thinks that \(\omega'\) is
possible.’
We now have:
Lemma 2.15
\(\omega' \in \mathcal{M}(\omega)\) iff \(\omega '\) is reachable from
\(\omega\).
Proof
.
and
Lemma 2.16
\(\mathcal{M}(\omega)\) is common knowledge for the agents of \(N\) at
\(\omega\).
Proof
.
and
Proposition 2.17
(Aumann 1976)
Let \(\mathcal{M}\) be the meet of the agents’ partitions
\(\mathcal{H}_i\) for each \(i \in N\). A proposition \(E \subseteq
\Omega\) is common knowledge for the agents of \(N\) at \(\omega\) iff
\(\mathcal{M}(\omega) \subseteq E\). (In Aumann (1976), \(E\) is
defined
to be common knowledge at \(\omega\) iff
\(\mathcal{M}(\omega) \subseteq E\).)
Proof
.
If \(E = \mathbf{K}^1_N (E)\), then \(E\) is a
public event
(Milgrom 1981) or a
common truism
(Binmore and Brandenburger
1989). Clearly, a common truism is common knowledge whenever it
occurs, since in this case \(E = \mathbf{K}^1_N (E) = \mathbf{K}^2_N
(E) =\ldots\) , so \(E = \mathbf{K}^*_N (E)\). The proof of
Proposition 2.17 shows that the common truisms are precisely the
elements of \(\mathcal{M}\) and unions of elements of \(\mathcal{M}\),
so any commonly known event is the consequence of a common truism.
2.4 Barwise’s Account
Barwise (1988) proposes another definition of common knowledge that
avoids explicit reference to the hierarchy of ‘\(i\) knows that
\(j\) knows that … knows that \(A\)’ propositions.
Barwise’s analysis builds upon an informal proposal by Harman
(1977). Consider the situation of the guest and clumsy waiter in
Example 1 when he announces that he was at fault. They are now in a
setting where they have heard the waiter’s announcement and know
that they are in the setting. Harman adopts the circularity in this
characterization of the setting as fundamental, and propses a
definition of common knowledge in terms of this circularity.
Barwise’s formal analysis gives a precise formulation of
Harman’s intuitive analysis of common knowledge as a
fixed
point
. Given a function \(f, A\) is a fixed point of \(f\) if
\(f(A)=A.\) Now note that
\[\begin{align}
\mathbf{K}^1_N (E \cap \bigcap_{m=1}^{\infty} \mathbf{K}^m_N(E))
   &= \mathbf{K}^1_N (E) \cap \mathbf{K}^1_N( \bigcap_{m=1}^{\infty} \mathbf{K}^m_N(E)) \\
   &= \mathbf{K}^1_N (E) \cap (\bigcap_{m=1}^{\infty} \mathbf{K}^1_N (\mathbf{K}^m_N (E))) \\
   &= \mathbf{K}^1_N (E) \cap (\bigcap_{m=1}^{\infty} \mathbf{K}^m_N (E)) \\
   &= \bigcap_{m=1}^{\infty} \mathbf{K}^m_N (E)
\end{align}\]
So we have established that \(\mathbf{K}^{*}_N (E)\) is a fixed point
of the function \(f_E\) defined by \(f_E (X) = \mathbf{K}^{1}_N (E
\cap X). f_E\) has other fixed points. For instance, any contradiction
\(B \cap B^c = \varnothing\) is a fixed point of
 \(f_E\).
[
15
]
Note also that if \(A \subseteq B\), then \(E \cap A \subseteq E \cap
B\) and so
\[
f_E (A) = \mathbf{K}^1_N (E \cap A) \subseteq \mathbf{K}^1_N (E \cap B) = f_E(B)
\]
that is, \(f_E\) is
monotone
. (We saw that \(\mathbf{K}^1_N\)
is also monotone in the proof of Proposition 2.4.) Barwise’s
analysis of common knowledge can be developed using the following
result from set theory:
Proposition
A monotone function \(f\) has a unique fixed point \(C\) such that if
\(B\) is a fixed point of \(f\), then \(B\subseteq C.\) \(C\) is the
greatest fixed point of
\(f.\)
This proposition establishes that \(f_E\) has a greatest fixed point,
which characterizes common knowledge in Barwise’s account. As
Barwise himself observes, the fixed point analysis of common knowledge
is closely related to Aumann’s partition account. This is easy
to see when one compares the fixed point analysis to the notion of
common truisms that Aumann’s account generates. Some authors
regard the fixed point analysis as an alternate formulation of
Aumann’s analysis. Barwise’s fixed point analysis of
common knowledge is favored by those who are especially interested in
the applications of common knowledge to problems in logic, while the
hierarchical and the partition accounts are favored by those who wish
to apply common knowledge in social philosophy and social science.
When knowledge operators satisfy the axioms (K1)-(K5), the Barwise
account of common knowledge is equivalent to the hierarchical
account.
Proposition 2.18
Let \(C^*_N\) be the greatest fixed point of \(f_E.\) Then \(C^{*}_N
(E) = K^*_N (E).\) (In Barwise (1988, 1989), \(E\) is
defined
to be common knowledge at \(\omega\) iff \(\omega \in C^*_N(E).)\)
Proof
.
Barwise argues that in fact the fixed point analysis is more flexible
and consequently more general than the hierarchical account. This may
surprise readers in light of Proposition 2.18, which shows that
Barwise’s fixed point definition is
equivalent
to the
hierarchical account. Indeed, while Barwise (1988, 1989) proves a
result showing that the fixed point account implies the hierarchical
account and gives examples that satisfy the common knowledge hierarchy
but fail to be fixed points, a number of authors who have written
after Barwise have given various proofs of the equivalence of the two
definitions, as was shown in Proposition 2.18. In fact, as (Heifetz
1999) shows, the hierarchical and fixed-point accounts are equivalent
for all finite levels of iteration, while fixed-point common knowledge
implies the conjunction of mutual knowledge up to any transfinite
order, but it is never implied by any such conjunction.
2.5 Gilbert’s Account
Gilbert (1989, Chapter 3) presents an alternative account of common
knowledge, which is meant to be more intuitively plausible than
Lewis’ and Aumann’s accounts. Gilbert gives a highly
detailed description of the circumstances under which agents have
common knowledge.
Definition 2.19
A set of agents \(N\) are in a
common knowledge situation
\(\mathcal{S}(A)\) with respect to a proposition \(A\) if, and only
if, \(\omega \in A\) and for each \(i \in N\),
(\(G_1\))
\(i\) is
epistemically normal
, in the sense that \(i\)
has normal perceptual organs which are functioning normally and has
normal reasoning
 capacity.
[
16
]
(\(G_2\))
\(i\) has the concepts needed to fulfill the other
conditions.
(\(G_3\))
\(i\) perceives the other agents of \(N\).
(\(G_4\))
\(i\) perceives that G\(_1\) and G\(_2\) are the case.
(\(G_5\))
\(i\) perceives that the state of affairs described by \(A\) is
the case.
(\(G_6\))
\(i\) perceives that all the agents of \(N\) perceive that \(A\)
is the case.
Gilbert’s definition appears to contain some redundancy, since
presumably an agent would not perceive A unless A is the case. Gilbert
is evidently trying to give a more explicit account of single agent
knowledge than Lewis and Aumann give. For Gilbert, agent \(i\) knows
that a proposition \(E\) is the case if, and only if, \(\omega \in
E\), that is, \(E\) is true, and either \(i\) perceives that the state
of affairs \(E\) describes obtains or \(i\) can infer \(E\) as a
consequence of other propositions \(i\) knows, given sufficient
inferential capacity.
Like Lewis, Gilbert recognizes that human agents do not in fact have
unlimited inferential capacity. To generate the infinite hierarchy of
mutual knowledge, Gilbert introduces the device of an agent’s
smooth-reasoner counterpart.
The smooth-reasoner counterpart
\(i'\) of an agent \(i\) is an agent that draws every logical
conclusion from every fact that \(i\) knows. Gilbert stipulates that
\(i'\) does not have any of the constraints on time, memory, or
reasoning ability that \(i\) might have, so \(i'\) can literally think
through the infinitely many levels of a common knowledge
hierarchy.
Definition 2.20
If a set of agents \(N\) are in a common knowledge situation
\(\mathcal{S}_N (A)\) with respect to \(A\), then the corresponding
set \(N'\) of their smooth-reasoner counterparts is in a
parallel
situation
\(\mathcal{S}'_{N'}(A)\) if, and only if, for each \(i'
\in N\),
(\(G'_1\))
\(i'\) can perceive anything that the counterpart \(i\) can
perceive.
(\(G_2'\))
\(G_2\)–\(G_6\) obtain for \(i'\) with respect to \(A\)
and \(N'\), same as for the counterpart \(i\) with respect to \(A\)
and \(N\).
(\(G_3'\))
\(i'\) perceives that all the agents of \(N'\) are
smooth-reasoners.
From this definition we get the following immediate consequence:
Proposition 2.21
If a set of smooth-reasoner counterparts to a set \(N\) of agents are
in a situation \(\mathcal{S}'_{N'}(A)\) parallel to a common knowledge
situation \(\mathcal{S}_N (A)\) of \(N\), then
for all \(m \in \mathbb{N}\) and for any \(i_1', \ldots ,i_m',
\mathbf{K}_{i_1'}\mathbf{K}_{i_2'} \ldots \mathbf{K}_{i_m'}(A)\).
Consequently, \(\mathbf{K}^{m}_{N'}(A)\) for any \(m \in
\mathbb{N}.\)
Gilbert argues that, given \(\mathcal{S}'_{N'}(A)\), the
smooth-reasoner counterparts of the agents of \(N\) actually satisfy a
much stronger condition, namely mutual knowledge
\(\mathbf{K}^{\alpha}_{N'}(A)\) to the level of any ordinal number
\(\alpha\), finite or infinite. When this stronger condition is
satisfied, the proposition \(A\) is said to be
open* to the agents
of
\(N\). With the concept of open*-ness, Gilbert gives her
definition of common knowledge.
Definition 2.22
A proposition \(E \subseteq \Omega\) is
Gilbert-common
knowledge
among the agents of a set \(N = \{1, \ldots,n\},\) if
and only if,
(\(G_1^*\))
\(E\) is open* to the agents of \(N\).
(\(G_2^*\))
For every \(i \in N,\) \(\mathbf{K}_i(G_1^*).\)
\(\mathbf{G}_N^*(E)\) denotes the proposition defined by \(G_1^*\) and
\(G_2^*\) for a set \(N\) of \(A^*\)-symmetric reasoners, so we can
say that \(E\) is Lewis-common knowledge for the agents of \(N\) iff
\(\omega \in \mathbf{G}_N^*(E)\).
One might think that an immediate corollary to Gilbert’s
definition is that Gilbert-common knowledge implies the hierarchical
common knowledge of Proposition 2.5. However, this claim follows only
on the assumption that an agent knows all of the propositions that her
smooth-reasoner counterpart reasons through. Gilbert does not
explicitly endorse this position, although she correctly observes that
Lewis and Aumann are committed to something like
 it.
[
17
]
Gilbert maintains that her account of common knowledge expresses our
intuitions with respect to common knowledge better than Lewis’
and Aumann’s accounts, since the notion of open*-ness presumably
makes explicit that when a proposition is common knowledge, it is
“out in the open”, so to speak.
3. Applications of Mutual and Common Knowledge
Readers primarily interested in philosophical applications of common
knowledge may want to focus on the No Disagreement Theorem and
Convention subsections. Readers interested in applications of common
knowledge in game theory may continue with the Strategic Form Games,
and Games of Perfect Information subsections.
3.1 The “No Disagreement” Theorem
3.2 Convention
3.3 Strategic Form Games
3.4 Games of Perfect Information
3.5 Communication Networks
3.1 The “No Disagreement” Theorem
Aumann (1976) originally used his definition of common knowledge to
prove a celebrated result that says that in a certain sense, agents
cannot “agree to disagree” about their beliefs, formalized
as probability distributions, if they start with common prior beliefs.
Since agents in a community often hold different opinions and know
they do so, one might attribute such differences to the agents’
having different private information. Aumann’s surprising result
is that even if agents condition their beliefs on private information,
mere common knowledge of their conditioned beliefs and a common prior
probability distribution implies that their beliefs cannot be
different, after all!
Proposition 3.1
Let \(\Omega\) be a finite set of states of the world. Suppose
that
Agents \(i\) and \(j\) have a common prior probability
distribution \(\mu(\cdot)\) over the events of \(\Omega\) such that
\(\mu(\omega) \gt 0\), for each \(\omega \in \Omega\), and
It is common knowledge at \(\omega\) that \(i\)’s posterior
probability of event \(E\) is \(q_i(E)\) and that \(j\)’s
posterior probability of \(E\) is \(q_j(E)\).
Then \(q_i(E) = q_j(E)\).
Proof
.
[Note that in the proof of this proposition, and in the sequel,
\(\mu(\cdot\mid B)\) denotes conditional probability; that is, given
\(\mu(B)\gt 0, \mu(A\mid B) = \mu(A\cap B)/\mu(B)\).]
In a later article, Aumann (1987) argues that the assumptions that
\(\Omega\) is finite and that \(\mu(\omega) \gt 0\) for each \(\omega
\in \Omega\) reflect the idea that agents only regard as
“really” possible a finite collection of salient worlds to
which they assign positive probability, so that one can drop the
states with probability 0 from the description of the state space.
Aumann also notes that this result implicitly assumes that the agents
have common knowledge of their partitions, since a description of each
possible world includes a description of the agents’ possibility
sets. And of course, this result depends crucially upon (i), which is
known as the
common prior assumption
(CPA).
Aumann’s “no disagreement” theorem has been
generalized in a number of ways in the literature. Cave 1983
generalizes the argument to 3 agents. Bacharach 1985 extends it to
cases in which agents observe each other’s decisions rather than
posteriors. Milgrom and Stokey, 1982 use it crucially for their
no-trade theorem, applying no disagreement to show that speculative
trade is impossible. Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis 1982 generalize the
argument to a dynamic setting in which two agents communicate their
posterior probabilities back and forth until they reach an agreement
– this particular take on the agreement theorem has been
characterized in terms of dynamic epistemic logic by Dégremont
and Roy, 2009 and applied to cases of epistemic peer disagreement by
Sillari 2019. McKelvey and Page 1986 further extend the results of
Geanakoplos and Polemarchakis to the case of \(n\) individuals. (See
also Monderer and Samet 1989 and, for a survey, Geanakoplos 1994.)
However, all of these “no disagreement” results raise the
same philosophical puzzle raised by Aumann’s original result:
How are we to explain differences in belief? Aumann’s result
leaves us with two options: (1) admit that at some level, common
knowledge of the agents’ beliefs or how they form their beliefs
fails, or (2) deny the CPA. Thus, even if agents do assign precise
posterior probabilities to an event, Aumann shows that if they have
merely first-order mutual knowledge of the posteriors, they can
“agree to
 disagree”.
[
18
]
Another way Aumann’s result might fail is if agents do not have
common knowledge that they update their beliefs by Bayesian
conditionalization. Then clearly, agents can explain divergent
opinions as the result of others having modified their beliefs in the
“wrong” way. However, there are cases in which neither
explanation will seem convincing and denying the requisite common
knowledge seems a rather
ad hoc
move. Why should one think
that such failures of common knowledge provide a general explanation
for divergent beliefs?
What of the second option, that is, denying the
 CPA?
[
19
]
The main argument put forward in favor of the CPA is that any
differences in agents’ probabilities should be the result of
their having different information only, that is, there is no reason
to think that the different beliefs that agents have regarding the
same event are the result of anything other than their having
different information. However, one can reply that this argument
amounts simply to a restatement of the Harsanyi
 Doctrine.
[
20
]
3.2 Convention
Schelling’s Department Store problem of Example 1.5 is a very
simple example in which the agents “solve” their
coordination problem appropriately by establishing a
convention.
(see also the entry on
convention
in this encyclopedia.) Using the vocabulary of game theory, Lewis
(1969) defines a convention as a
strict coordination
equilibrium
of a game which agents follow on account of their
common knowledge that they all prefer to follow this coordination
equilibrium in a recurrent coordination problem. A coordination
equilibrium of a game is a strategy combination such that no agent is
better off if any agent unilaterally deviates from this combination.
As with equilibria in general, a coordination equilibrium is
strict
if any agent who deviates unilaterally from the
equilibrium is strictly worse off. The strategic form game of Figure
1.3 summarizes Liz’s and Robert’s situation. The
Department Store game has four Nash equilibrium outcomes in pure
strategies: \((s_1, s_1),\) \((s_2, s_2),\) \((s_3, s_3)\), and
\((s_4,
 s_4)\).
[
21
]
These four equilibria are all strict coordination equilibria. If the
agents follow either of these equilibria, then they coordinate
successfully. For agents to be following a Lewis-convention in this
situation, they must follow one of the game’s coordination
equilibria. However, for Lewis to follow a coordination equilibrium is
not a sufficient condition for agents to be following a convention.
For suppose that Liz and Robert fail to analyze their predicament
properly at all, but Liz chooses \(s_2\) and Robert chooses \(s_2\),
so that they coordinate at \((s_2, s_2)\) by sheer luck. Lewis does
not count accidental coordination of this sort as a convention.
Suppose next that both agents are Bayesian rational, and that part of
what each agent knows is the payoff structure of the Intersection
game. If the agents expect each other to follow \((s_2, s_2)\) and
they consequently coordinate successfully, are they then following a
convention? Not necessarily, contends Lewis in a subtle argument on p.
59 of
Convention.
For while each agent knows the game and
that she is rational, still she might not attribute the same knowledge
to the other agent. If each agent believes that the other agent will
follow her end of the \((s_2, s_2)\) equilibrium mindlessly, then her
best response is to follow her end of \((s_2, s_2)\). But in this case
the agents coordinated as the result of their each falsely believing
that the other acts like an automaton, and Lewis thinks that any
proper account of convention must require that agents have
correct
beliefs about one another. In particular, Lewis
requires that each agent involved in a convention must have mutual
expectations that each is acting with the aim of coordinating with the
other. The argument can be carried further on. What if both agents
believe that they will follow \((s_2, s_2)\), and believe that each
other will do so thinking that the other will choose \(s_2\)
rationally and not mindlessly? Then, say, Liz would coordinate as the
result of her false second-order belief that Robert believes that Liz
acts mindlessly. Similarly for third-order beliefs and so on for any
higher order of knowledge.
Lewis concludes that a necessary condition for agents to be following
a convention is that their preferences to follow the corresponding
coordination equilibrium be common knowledge (the issue whether
conventions need to be common knowledge has been debated recently, cf.
Cubitt and Sugden 2003, Binmore 2008, Sillari 2008, and, for an
experimental approach, see Devetag et al. 2013, for a connection to
the topic of rule-following, see Sillari 2013). So on Lewis’
account, a convention for a set of agents is a coordination
equilibrium which the agents follow on account of their common
knowledge of their rationality, the payoff structure of the relevant
game and that each agent follows her part of the equilibrium.
A regularity \(R\) in the behavior of members of a population \(P\)
when they are agents in a recurrent situation \(S\) is a
convention
if and only if it is true that, and it is common
knowledge in \(P\) that, in any instance of \(S\) among the members of
\(P\),
everyone conforms to \(R\);
everyone expects everyone else to conform to \(R\);
everyone has approximately the same preferences regarding all
possible combinations of actions;
everyone prefers that everyone conform to \(R\), on condition that
at least all but one conform to R;
everyone would prefer that everyone conform to \(R'\), on
condition that at least all but one conform to \(R'\),
where \(R'\) is some possible regularity in the behavior of members of
\(P\) in \(S\), such that no one in any instance of \(S\) among
members of \(P\) could conform both to \(R'\) and to \(R\).
(Lewis 1969, p.
 76)
[
22
]
Lewis includes the requirement that there be an alternate coordination
equilibrium \(R'\) besides the equilibrium \(R\) that all follow in
order to capture the fundamental intuition that how the agents who
follow a convention behave depends crucially upon how they expect the
others to behave.
Sugden (1986) and Vanderschraaf (1998) argue that it is not crucial to
the notion of convention that the corresponding equilibrium be a
coordination equilibrium. Lewis’ key insight is that a
convention is a pattern of mutually beneficial behavior which depends
on the agents’ common knowledge that all follow
this
pattern, and no other. Vanderschraaf gives a more general definition
of convention as a
strict
equilibrium together with common
knowledge that all follow this equilibrium and that all would have
followed a different equilibrium had their beliefs about each other
been different. An example of this more general kind of convention is
given below in the discussion of the Figure 3.1 example.
3.3 Strategic Form Games
Lewis formulated the notion of common knowledge as part of his general
account of conventions. In the years following the publication of
Convention
, game theorists have recognized that any
explanation of a particular pattern of play in a game depends
crucially on mutual and common knowledge assumptions. More
specifically,
solution concepts
in game theory are both
motivated and justified in large part by the mutual or common
knowledge the agents in the game have regarding their situation.
To establish the notation that will be used in the discussion that
follows, the usual definitions of a game in strategic form, expected
utility and agents’ distributions over their opponents’
strategies, are given here:
Definition 3.2
A
game
\(\Gamma\) is an ordered triple \((N, S,
\boldsymbol{u})\) consisting of the following elements:
A finite set \(N = \{1,2, \ldots ,n\}\), called the
set of
agents
or
players.
For each agent \(k \in N\), there is a finite set \(S_k =
\{s_{k1},s_{k2}, \ldots ,s_{kn_k}\}\), called the
alternative pure
strategies
for agent \(k\). The Cartesian product \(S = S_1
\times \ldots \times S_n\) is called the
pure strategy set
for the game \(\Gamma\).
A map \(\boldsymbol{u} : S \rightarrow \Re^n,\) called the
utility
or
payoff function
on the pure strategy set.
At each strategy combination \(\boldsymbol{s} = (s_{1j_1}, \ldots
,s_{nj_n}) \in S\), agent \(k\)’s particular payoff or utility
is given by the \(k\)
th
component of the value of
\(\boldsymbol{u}\), that is, agent \(k\)’s utility \(u_k\) at
\(\boldsymbol{s}\) is determined by 

\[
u_k (\boldsymbol{s}) = I_k (\boldsymbol{u}(s_{1j_1}, \ldots ,s_{nj_n}))
\]
where \(I_k (\boldsymbol{x})\) projects \(\boldsymbol{x} \in \Re^n\)
onto its \(k\)
th
component.
The subscript ‘\(-k\)’ indicates the result of removing
the \(k\)
th
component of an \(n\)-tuple or an \(n\)-fold
Cartesian product. For instance,
\[
S_{-k} = S_1 \times \ldots \times S_{k-1} \times S_{k+1} \times \ldots \times S_n
\]
denotes the pure strategy combinations that agent \(k\)’s
opponents may play.
Now let us formally introduce a system of the agents’ beliefs
into this framework. \(\Delta_k (S_{-k})\) denotes the set of
probability distributions over the measurable space \((S_{-k},
\mathfrak{F}_k)\), where \(\mathfrak{F}_k\) denotes the Boolean
algebra generated by the strategy combinations \(S_{-k}\). Each agent
\(k\) has a probability distribution \(\mu_k \in \Delta_k(S_{-k})\),
and this distribution determines the (
Savage
)
expected
utilities
for each of \(k\)’s possible acts:
\[
E(u_k (s_{k j})) = \sum_{A_{-k} \in S_{-k}} u_k (s_{kj}, \boldsymbol{s}_{-k}) \mu_k (\boldsymbol{s}_{-k}),\ j = 1, 2, \ldots ,n_k
\]
If \(i\) is an opponent of \(k\), then \(i\)’s individual
strategy \(s_{i j}\) may be characterized as a union of strategy
combinations \(\bigcup\{\boldsymbol{s}_{-k}\mid s_{ij}\in
\boldsymbol{s}_{-k}\} \in \mathfrak{F}_k\), and so \(k\)’s
marginal probability for \(i\)’s strategy \(s_{i j}\) may be
calculated as follows:
\[
\mu_k (s_{ij}) = \sum_{\{s_{-k}\mid s_{ij}\in s_{-k}\}} \mu_{k}(s_{-k})
\]
\(\mu_k(\cdot \mid A)\) denotes \(k\)’s conditional probability
distribution given a set \(A\), and \(E(\cdot \mid A)\) denotes
\(k\)’s conditional expectation given \(\mu_k(\cdot\mid
A).\)
Suppose first that the agents have common knowledge of the full payoff
structure of the game they are engaged in and that they are all
rational, and that no other information is common knowledge. In other
words, each agent knows that her opponents are expected utility
maximizers, but does not in general know exactly which strategies they
will choose or what their probabilities for her acts are. These common
knowledge assumptions are the motivational basis for the solution
concept for noncooperative games known as
rationalizability
,
introduced independently by Bernheim (1984) and Pearce (1984). Roughly
speaking, a
rationalizable strategy
is any strategy an agent
may choose without violating common knowledge of Bayesian rationality.
Bernheim and Pearce argue that when only the structure of the game and
the agents’ Bayesian rationality are common knowledge, the game
should be considered “solved” if every agent plays a
rationalizable strategy. For instance, in the “Chicken”
game with payoff structure defined by Figure 3.1,
Joanna
\(s_1\)
\(s_2\)
Lizzi
\(s_1\)
(3,3)
(2,4)
\(s_2\)
(4,2)
(0,0)
Figure 3.1
if Joanna and Lizzi have common knowledge of all of the payoffs at
every strategy combination, and they have common knowledge that both
are Bayesian rational, then any of the four pure strategy profiles is
rationalizable. For if their beliefs about each other are defined by
the probabilities
\[\begin{align}
\alpha_1 &= \mu_1 \text{ (Joanna plays } s_1), \text{ and} \\
\alpha_2 &= \mu_2 \text{ (Lizzi plays } s_1)
\end{align}\]
then
\[
 E(u_i (s_1)) = 3\alpha_i + 2(1 - \alpha_i) = \alpha_i + 2
\]
and
\[
 E(u_i (s_2)) = 4\alpha_i + 0(1 - \alpha_i) = 4\alpha_i, \ i = 1, 2
\]
so each agent maximizes her expected utility by playing \(s_1\) if
\(\alpha_i + 2 \ge 4\alpha_i\) or \(\alpha_i \le 2/3\) and maximizes
her expected utility by playing \(s_2\) if \(\alpha_i \ge 2/3\). If it
so happens that \(\alpha_i \gt 2/3\) for both agents, then both
conform with Bayesian rationality by playing their respective ends of
the strategy combination \((s_2,s_2)\)
given their beliefs
,
even though each would want to defect from this strategy combination
were she to discover that the other is in fact going to play \(s_2\).
Note that the game’s pure strategy Nash equilibria, \((s_1,
s_2)\) and \((s_2, s_1)\), are rationalizable, since it is rational
for Lizzi and Joanna to conform with either equilibrium given
appropriate distributions. In general, the set of a game’s
rationalizable strategy combinations contains the set of the
game’s pure strategy Nash
 equilibria.
[
23
]
Rationalizability can be defined formally in several ways. A variation
of Bernheim’s original (1984) definition is given here.
Definition 3.3
Given that each agent \(k \in N\) has a probability distribution
\(\mu_k \in \Delta_k(s_{-k})\), the system of beliefs 

\[
  \boldsymbol{\mu} = (\mu_1 , \ldots ,\mu_n) \in \Delta_1 (S_{-1}) \times \cdots \times \Delta_n (S_{-n})
\]
is
Bayes concordant
if and only if,
(3.i)
For \(i \ne k, \mu_i (s_{kj}) \gt 0 \Rightarrow s_{kj}\) maximizes
\(k\)’s expected utility for some \(\sigma_k \in
\Delta_k(s_{-k}),\)
and (3.i) is common knowledge. A pure strategy combination
\(\boldsymbol{s} = (s_{1j_1}, \ldots ,s_{nj_n}) \in S\) is
rationalizable
if and only if the agents have a Bayes
concordant system
\(\mu\)
of beliefs and, for each
agent \(k \in N\),
(3.ii)
\(E(u_k (s_{kj_k})) \ge E(u_k (s_{ki_k})),\) for \(i_k \ne
 j_k\).
[
24
]
The following result shows that the common knowledge restriction on
the distributions in Definition 3.1 formalizes the assumption that the
agents have common knowledge of Bayesian rationality.
Proposition 3.4
In a game \(\Gamma\), common knowledge of Bayesian rationality is
satisfied if, and only if, (3.i) is common knowledge.
Proof
.
When agents have common knowledge of the game and their Bayesian
rationality only, one can predict that they will follow a
rationalizable strategy profile. However, rationalizability becomes an
unstable solution concept if the agents come to know more about one
another. For instance, in the Chicken example above with \(\alpha_i
\gt 2/3, i = 1, 2\), if either agent were to discover the other
agent’s beliefs about her, she would have good reason not to
follow the \((s_2,s_2)\) profile and to revise her own beliefs
regarding the other agent. If, in the other hand, it so happens that
\(\alpha_1 = 1\) and \(\alpha_2 = 0\), so that the agents maximize
expected payoff by following the \((s_2, s_1)\) profile, then should
the agents discover their beliefs about each other, they will still
follow \((s_2, s_1)\). Indeed, if their beliefs are common knowledge,
then one can predict with certainty that they will follow
\((s_2,s_1)\). The Nash equilibrium \((s_2,s_1)\) is characterized by
the belief distributions defined by \(\alpha_1 = 1\) and \(\alpha_2 =
0\).
The Nash equilibrium is a special case of
correlated equilibrium
concepts
, which are defined in terms of the belief distributions
of the agents in a game. In general, a correlated
equilibrium-in-beliefs is a system of agents’ probability
distributions which remains stable given common knowledge of the game,
rationality and the
beliefs themselves
. We will review two
alternative correlated equilibrium concepts (Aumann 1974, 1987;
Vanderschraaf 1995, 2001), and show how each generalizes the Nash
equilibrium concept.
Definition 3.5
Given that each agent \(k \in N\) has a probability distribution
\(\mu_k \in \Delta_k (s_{-k})\), the system of beliefs
\[
 \boldsymbol{\mu}^* = (\mu_1^*, \ldots ,\mu_n^* ) \in \Delta_1 (s_{-1}) \times \ldots \times \Delta_n (s_{-n})
\]
is an
endogenous correlated equilibrium
if, and only if,
(3.iii)
For \(i \ne k, \mu_i^*(s_{kj}) \gt 0 \Rightarrow s_{kj}\)
maximizes \(k\)’s expected utility given \(\mu_k^*.\)
If \(\boldsymbol{\mu}^*\) is an endogenous correlated equilibrium a
pure strategy combination \(\boldsymbol{s}^* = (s_1^*, \ldots ,s_n^*)
\in S\) is an
endogenous correlated equilibrium strategy
combination given
\(\boldsymbol{\mu}^*\) if, and only if, for
each agent \(k \in N,\)
(3.iv)
\(E(u_k (s_k^*)) \ge E(u_k (s_{ki}))\) for \(s_{ki} \ne
s_k^*.\)
Hence, the endogenous correlated equilibrium \(\boldsymbol{\mu}^*\)
restricts the set of strategies that the agents might follow, as do
the Bayes concordant beliefs of rationalizability. However, the
endogenous correlated equilibrium concept is a proper refinement of
rationalizability, because the latter does not presuppose that
condition (3.iii) holds with respect to the beliefs one’s
opponents actually have. If exactly one pure strategy combination
\(\boldsymbol{s}^*\) satisfies (3.iv) given \(\boldsymbol{\mu}^*\),
then \(\boldsymbol{\mu}^*\) is a
strict equilibrium
, and in
this case one can predict with certainty what the agents will do given
common knowledge of the game, rationality and their beliefs. Note that
Definition 3.5 says nothing about whether or not the agents regard
their opponents’ strategy combinations as probabilistically
independent. Also, this definition does not require that the
agents’ probabilities are
consistent
, in the sense that
agents’ probabilities for a mutual opponent’s acts agree.
A simple refinement of the endogenous correlated equilibrium concept
characterizes the Nash equilibrium concept.
Definition 3.6
A system of agents’ beliefs \(\boldsymbol{\mu}^*\) is a
Nash
equilibrium
if, and only if,
condition (3.iii) is satisfied,
For each \(k \in N, \mu_k^*\) satisfies probabilistic
independence, and
For each \(s_{kj} \in s_k\), if \(i, l \ne k\) then
\(\mu_i^*(s_{kj}) = \mu_l^*(s_{kj})\).
In other words, an endogenous correlated equilibrium is a Nash
equilibrium-in-beliefs when each agent regards the moves of his
opponents as probabilistically independent and the agents’
probabilities are consistent. Note that in the 2-agent case,
conditions (b) and (c) of the Definition 3.6 are always satisfied, so
for 2-agent games the endogenous correlated equilibrium concept
reduces to the Nash equilibrium concept. Conditions (b) and (c) are
traditionally assumed in game theory, but Skyrms (1991) and
Vanderschraaf (1995, 2001) argue that there may be good reasons to
relax these assumptions in games with 3 or more agents.
Brandenburger and Dekel (1988) show that in 2-agent games, if the
beliefs of the agents are common knowledge, condition (3.iii)
characterizes a Nash equilibrium-in-beliefs. As they note, condition
(3.iii) characterizes a Nash equilibrium in beliefs for the
\(n\)-agent case if the probability distributions are consistent and
satisfy probabilistic independence. Proposition 3.7 extends
Brandenburger and Dekel’s result to the endogenous correlated
equilibrium concept by relaxing the consistency and probabilistic
independence assumptions.
Proposition 3.7
Assume that the probabilities
\[
 \mu = (\mu_1 ,\ldots ,\mu_n) \in \Delta_1 (s_{-1}) \times \ldots \times \Delta_n (s_{-n})
\]
are common knowledge. Then common knowledge of Bayesian rationality is
satisfied if, and only if, \(\boldsymbol{\mu}\) is an endogenous
correlated equilibrium.
Proof
.
In addition, we have:
Corollary 3.8
(Brandenburger and Dekel, 1988)
Assume in a 2-agent game that the probabilities
\[
 \boldsymbol{\mu} = (\mu_1,\mu_2) \in \Delta_1 (s_{-1}) \times \Delta_2 (s_{-2})
\]
are common knowledge. Then common knowledge of Bayesian rationality is
satisfied if, and only if, \(\boldsymbol{\mu}\) is a Nash
equilibrium.
Proof.
The endogenous correlated equilibrium concept reduces to the Nash
equilibrium concept in the 2-agent case, so the corollary follows by
Proposition 3.7.
If \(\boldsymbol{\mu}^*\) is a strict equilibrium, then one can
predict which pure strategy profile the agents in a game will follow
given common knowledge of the game, rationality and
\(\boldsymbol{\mu}^*.\) But if \(\boldsymbol{\mu}^*\) is such that
several distinct pure strategy profiles satisfy (3.iv) with respect to
\(\boldsymbol{\mu}^*\), then one can no longer predict with certainty
what the agents will do. For instance, in the Chicken game of Figure
3.1, the belief distributions defined by \(\alpha_1 = \alpha_2 = 2/3\)
together are a Nash equilibrium-in-beliefs. Given common knowledge of
this equilibrium, either pure strategy is a best reply for each agent,
in the sense that either pure strategy maximizes expected utility.
Indeed, if agents can also adopt randomized or
mixed
strategies at which they follow one of several pure strategies
according to the outcome of a chance experiment, then any of the
infinitely mixed strategies an agent might adopt in Chicken is a best
reply given
 \(\boldsymbol{\mu}^*\).
[
25
]
So the endogenous correlated equilibrium concept does not determine
the exact outcome of a game in all cases, even if one assumes
probabilistic consistency and independence so that the equilibrium is
a Nash equilibrium.
Another correlated equilibrium concept formalized by Aumann (1974,
1987) does give a determinate prediction of what agents will do in a
game given appropriate common knowledge. To illustrate Aumann’s
correlated equilibrium concept, let us consider the Figure 3.1 game
once more. If Joanna and Lizzi can tie their strategies to their
knowledge of the possible worlds in a certain way, they can follow a
system of correlated strategies which will yield a payoff vector they
both prefer to that of the mixed Nash equilibrium and which is itself
an equilibrium. One way they can achieve this is to have their friend
Ron play a variation of the familiar shell game by hiding a pea under
one of three walnut shells, numbered 1, 2 and 3. Joanna and Lizzi both
think that each of the three relevant possible worlds corresponding to
\(\omega_k = \{\)the pea lies under shell \(k\}\) is equally likely.
Ron then gives Lizzi and Joanna each a private recommendation, based
upon the outcome of the game, which defines a system of strategy
combinations f as follows
\[\tag{\(\star\)}
f(\omega) =
\begin{cases}
 (s_1, s_1) \text{ if } \omega_k = \omega_1 \\
 (s_1, s_2) \text{ if } \omega_k = \omega_2 \\
 (s_2, s_1) \text{ if } \omega_k = \omega_3
\end{cases}
\]
\(f\) is a
correlated
strategy system because the agents tie
their strategies, by following their recommendations, to the same set
of states of the world \(\Omega\). \(f\) is also a strict
Aumann
correlated equilibrium
, for if each agent knows how Ron makes his
recommendations, but knows only the recommendation he gives her,
either would do strictly worse were she to deviate from her
 recommendation.
[
26
]
Since there are several strict equilibria of Chicken, \(f\)
corresponds to a convention as defined in Vanderschraaf (1998). The
overall expected payoff vector of \(f\) is (3,3), which lies outside
the convex hull of the payoffs for the game’s Nash equilibria
and which Pareto-dominates the expected payoff vector (4/3, 4/3), of
the mixed Nash equilibrium defined by \(\alpha_1 = 2/3\), \(i = 1,
 2.\)
[
27
]
The correlated equilibrium f is characterized by the probability
distribution of the agents’ play over the strategy profiles,
given in Figure 3.3:
Joanna
\(s_1\)
\(s_2\)
Lizzi

\(s_2\)

Figure 3.3
Aumann (1987) proves a result relating his correlated equilibrium
concept to common knowledge. To review this result, we must give the
formal definition of Aumann correlated equilibrium.
Definition 3.9
Given a game \(\Gamma = (N, S, \boldsymbol{u})\) together with a
finite set of possible worlds \(\Omega\), the vector valued function
\(f: \Omega \rightarrow S\) is a
correlated n-tuple.
If
\(f(\omega) = (f_1 (\omega), \ldots ,f_n (\omega))\) denotes the
components of \(f\) for the agents of \(N\), then agent \(k\)’s
recommended strategy
at \(\omega\) is \(f_k (\omega).\) \(f\)
is an
Aumann correlated equilibrium
iff 

\[
E(u_k \circ f) \ge E(u_k (f_{-k}, g_k)),
\]
for each \(k \in N\) and for any function \(g_k\) that is a function
of \(f_i\).
The agents are at Aumann correlated equilibrium if at each possible
world \(\omega \in \Omega\), no agent will want to deviate from his
recommended strategy, given that the others follow their recommended
strategies. Hence, Aumann correlated equilibrium uniquely specifies
the strategy of each agent, by explicitly introducing a space of
possible worlds to which agents can correlate their acts. The
deviations \(g_i\) are required to be functions of \(f_i\), that is,
compositions of some other function with \(f_i\), because \(i\) is
informed of \(f_i (\omega)\) only, and so can only distinguish between
the possible worlds of \(\Omega\) that are distinguished by \(f_i\).
As noted already, the primary difference between Aumann’s notion
of correlated equilibrium and the endogenous correlated equilibrium is
that in Aumann’s correlated equilibrium, the agents correlate
their strategies to some event \(\omega \in \Omega\) that is external
to the game. One way to view this difference is that agents who
correlate their strategies exogenously can calculate their expected
utilities conditional on their own strategies.
In Aumann’s model, a description of each possible world
\(\omega\) includes descriptions of the following: the game
\(\Gamma\), the agent’s private information partitions, and the
actions chosen by each agent at \(\omega\), and each agent’s
prior probability distribution \(\mu_k(\cdot)\) over \(\Omega\). The
basic idea is that conditional on \(\omega\), everyone knows
everything that can be the object of uncertainty on the part of any
agent, but in general, no agent necessarily knows which world
\(\omega\) is the actual world. The agents can use their priors to
calculate the probabilities that the various act combinations
\(\boldsymbol{s} \in S\) are played. If the agents’ priors are
such that for all \(i, j \in N,\) \(\mu_i(\omega) = 0\) iff \(\mu_j
(\omega) = 0,\) then the agents’ priors are
mutually
absolutely continuous
. If the agents’ priors all agree,
that is, \(\mu_1 (\omega) = \ldots = \mu_n (\omega) = \mu(\omega)\)
for each \(\omega \in \Omega\), then it is said that the
common
prior assumption
, or CPA, is satisfied. If agents are following
an Aumann correlated equilibrium \(f\) and the CPA is satisfied, then
\(f\) is an
objective
Aumann correlated equilibrium. An
Aumann correlated equilibrium is a Nash equilibrium if the CPA is
satisfied and the agents’ distributions satisfy probabilistic
 independence.
[
28
]
Let \(s_i (\omega)\) denote the strategy chosen by agent \(i\) at
possible world \(\omega\). Then \(s: \Omega \rightarrow S\) defined by
\(s(\omega) = ( s_1 (\omega),\ldots ,s_n (\omega) )\) is a correlated
\(n\)-tuple. Given that \(\mathcal{H}_i\) is a partition of
 \(\Omega\),
[
29
]
the function \(s_i : \Omega \rightarrow s_i\) defined by \(s\) is
\(\mathcal{H}_i\)-
measurable
if for each \(\mathcal{H}_{ij}
\in \mathcal{H}_{i}, s_i (\omega')\) is constant for each \(\omega'
\in \mathcal{H}_{ij}.\) \(\mathcal{H}_i\)-measurability is a formal
way of saying that \(i\) knows what she will do at each possible
world, given her information.
Definition 3.10
Agent \(i\) is
Bayes rational
with respect to \(\omega \in
\Omega\) (alternatively, \(\omega\)
-Bayes rational
) iff
\(s_i\) is \(\mathcal{H}_i\)-measurable and
\[
E(u_i \circ s \mid \mathcal{H}_i)(\omega) \ge E(u_i (v_i, s_{-i}) \mid \mathcal{H}_i)(\omega)
\]
for any \(\mathcal{H}_i\)-measurable function \(v_i : \Omega
\rightarrow s_i\).
Note that Aumann’s definition of \(\omega\)-Bayesian rationality
implies that \(\mu_i (\mathcal{H}_i (\omega)) \gt 0\), so that the
conditional expectations are defined. Aumann’s main result,
given next, implicitly assumes that \(\mu_i (\mathcal{H}_i (\omega))
\gt 0\) for every agent \(i \in N\) and every possible world \(\omega
\in \Omega\). This poses no technical difficulties if the CPA is
satisfied, or even if the priors are only mutually absolutely
continuous, since if this is the case then one can simply drop any
\(\omega\) with zero prior from consideration.
Proposition 3.11
(Aumann 1987)
If each agent \(i \in N\) is \(\omega\)-Bayes rational at each
possible world \(\omega \in \Omega\), then the agents are following an
Aumann correlated equilibrium. If the CPA is satisfied, then the
correlated equilibrium is objective.
Proof
.
Part of the uncertainty the agents might have about their situation is
whether or not all agents are rational. But if it is assumed that all
agents are \(\omega\)-Bayesian rational at each \(\omega \in \Omega\),
then a description of this fact forms part of the description of each
possible \(\omega\) and thus lies in the meet of the agents’
partitions. As noted already, descriptions of the agents’
priors, their partitions and the game also form part of the
description of each possible world, so propositions corresponding to
these facts also lie in the meet of the agents’ partitions. So
another way of stating Aumann’s main result is as follows:
Common knowledge of
\(\omega\)-
Bayesian rationality at
each possible world implies that the agents follow an Aumann
correlated equilibrium
.
Propositions 3.7 and 3.11 are powerful results. They say that common
knowledge of rationality and of agents beliefs about each other,
quantified as their probability distributions over the strategy
profiles they might follow, implies that the agents’ beliefs
characterize an equilibrium of the game. Then if the agents’
beliefs are unconditional, Proposition 3.7 says that the agents are
rational to follow a strategy profile consistent with the
corresponding endogenous correlated equilibrium. If their beliefs are
conditional on their private information partitions, then Proposition
3.11 says they are rational to follow the strategies the corresponding
Aumann correlated equilibrium recommends. However, we must not
overestimate the importance of these results, for they say nothing
about the
origins
of the common knowledge of rationality and
beliefs. For instance, in the Chicken game of Figure 3.1, we
considered an example of a correlated equilibrium in which it was
assumed
that Lizzi and Joanna had common knowledge of the
system of recommended strategies defined by \((\star).\) Given this
common knowledge, Joanna and Lizzi indeed have decisive reason to
follow the Aumann correlated equilibrium f. But where did this common
knowledge come from? How, in general, do agents come to have the
common knowledge which justifies their conforming to an equilibrium?
Philosophers and social scientists have made only limited progress in
addressing this question.
3.4 Games of Perfect Information
In extensive form games, the agents move in sequence. At each stage,
the agent who is to move must base her decisions upon what she knows
about the preceding moves. This part of the agent’s knowledge is
characterized by an
information set
, which is the set of
alternative moves that an agent knows her predecessor might have
chosen. For instance, consider the extensive form game of Figure
3.4:
Figure 3.4
When Joanna moves she is at her information set \(I^{22} = \{C^1,
D^1\},\) that is, she moves knowing that Lizzi might have chosen
either \(C^1\) or \(D^1\), so this game is an extensive form
representation of the Chicken game of Figure 3.1.
In a game of perfect information, each information set consists of a
single node in the game tree, since by definition at each state the
agent who is to move knows exactly how her predecessors have moved. In
Example 1.4 it was noted that the method of backwards induction can be
applied to any game of perfect
 information.
[
30
]
The backwards induction solution is the unique Nash equilibrium of a
game of perfect information. The following result gives sufficient
conditions to justify backwards induction play in a game of perfect
information:
Proposition 3.12
(Bicchieri 1993)
In an extensive form game of perfect information, the agents follow
the backwards induction solution if the following conditions are
satisfied for each agent \(i\) at each information set \(I^{ik}\):
\(i\) is rational, \(i\) knows this and \(i\) knows the game,
and
At any information set \(I^{jk + 1}\) that immediately follows
\(I^{ik}, i\) knows at \(I^{ik}\) what \(j\) knows at \(I^{jk +
1}\).
Proof
.
Proposition 3.12 says that far less than common knowledge of the game
and of rationality suffices for the backwards induction solution to
obtain in a game of perfect information. All that is needed is for
each agent at each of her information sets to be rational, to know the
game and to know what the next agent to move knows! For instance, in
the Figure 1.2 game, if \(R_1 (R_2)\) stands for “Alan (Fiona)
is rational” and \(\mathbf{K}_i (\Gamma)\) stands for
“\(i\) knows the game \(\Gamma\)”, then the backwards
induction solution is implied by the following:
At \(I^{24}, R_2\) and \(\mathbf{K}_2 (\Gamma)\).
At \(I^{13}, R_1, \mathbf{K}_1 (\Gamma), \mathbf{K}_1 (R_2)\), and
\(\mathbf{K}_1\mathbf{K}_2 (\Gamma)\).
At \(I^{22}, \mathbf{K}_2 (R_1), \mathbf{K}_2\mathbf{K}_1 (R_2)\),
and \(\mathbf{K}_2\mathbf{K}_1\mathbf{K}_2 (\Gamma)\).
At \(I ^{11}, \mathbf{K}_1\mathbf{K}_2 (R_1),
\mathbf{K}_1\mathbf{K}_2\mathbf{K}_1 (R_2)\), and
\(\mathbf{K}_1\mathbf{K}_2\mathbf{K}_1\mathbf{K}_2
 (\Gamma)\).
[
31
]
One might think that a corollary to Proposition 3.11 is that in a game
of perfect information, common knowledge of the game and of
rationality implies the backwards induction solution. This is the
classical argument
for the backwards induction solution. Many
game theorists continue to accept the classical argument, but in
recent years, the argument has come under strong challenge, led by the
work of Reny (1988, 1992), Binmore (1987) and Bicchieri (1989, 1993).
The basic idea underlying their criticisms of backwards induction can
be illustrated with the Figure 1.2 game. According to the classical
argument, if Alan and Fiona have common knowledge of rationality and
the game, then each will predict that the other will follow her end of
the backwards induction solution, to which his end of the backwards
induction solution is his unique best response. However, what if Fiona
reconsiders what to do if she finds herself at the information set
\(I^{22}\)? If the information set \(I^{22}\) is reached, then Alan
has of course not followed the backwards induction solution. If we
assume that at \(I^{22}\), Fiona knows only what is stated in (iii),
then she can explain her being at \(I^{22}\) as a failure of either
\(\mathbf{K}_1\mathbf{K}_2\mathbf{K}_1 (R_2)\) or
\(\mathbf{K}_1\mathbf{K}_2\mathbf{K}_1\mathbf{K}_2 (\Gamma)\) at
\(I^{11}\). In this case, Fiona’s thinking that either
\(\neg\mathbf{K}_1\mathbf{K}_2\mathbf{K}_1 (R_2)\) or
\(\neg\mathbf{K}_1\mathbf{K}_2\mathbf{K}_1\mathbf{K}_2(\Gamma)\) at
\(I^{11}\) is compatible with what Alan in fact does know at
\(I^{11}\), so Fiona should not necessarily be surprised to find
herself at \(I^{22}\), and given that what she knows there is
characterized by (iii), following the backwards induction solution is
her best strategy. But if rationality and the game are common
knowledge, or even if Fiona and Alan both have just have mutual
knowledge of the statements characterized by (iii) and (iv), then at
\(I^{22}\), Fiona knows that \(\mathbf{K}_1\mathbf{K}_2\mathbf{K}_1
(R_2)\) or \(\mathbf{K}_1\mathbf{K}_2\mathbf{K}_1\mathbf{K}_2
(\Gamma)\) at \(I^{11}\). Hence given this much mutual knowledge,
Fiona no longer can explain why Alan has deviated from the backwards
induction solution, since this deviation contradicts part of what is
their mutual knowledge. So if she finds herself at \(I^{22}\), Fiona
does not necessarily have good reason to think that Alan will follow
the backwards induction solution of the subgame beginning at
\(I^{22}\), and hence she might not have good reason to follow the
backwards induction solution, either. Bicchieri (1993), who along with
Binmore (1987) and Reny (1988, 1992) extends this argument to games of
perfect information with arbitrary length, draws a startling
conclusion: If agents have strictly too few or
strictly too
many
levels of mutual knowledge of rationality and the game
relative to the number of potential moves, one cannot predict that
they will follow the backwards induction solution. This would
undermine the central role backwards induction has played in the
analysis of extensive form games. For why should the number of levels
of mutual knowledge the agents have depend upon the length of the
game?
The classical argument for backwards induction implicitly assumes that
at each stage of the game, the agents discount the preceding moves as
strategically irrelevant. Defenders of the classical argument can
argue that this assumption makes sense, since by definition at any
agents’ decision node, the previous moves that led to this node
are now fixed. Critics of the classical argument question this
assumption, contending that when reasoning about how to move at any of
his information sets,
including those not on the backwards
induction equilibrium path
, part of what an agent must consider
is what conditions might have led to his being at that information
set. In other words, agents should incorporate reasoning about the
reasoning of the previous movers, or
forward induction
reasoning, into their deliberations over how to move at a given
information set. Binmore (1987) and Bicchieri (1993) contend that a
backwards induction solution to a game should be consistent with the
solution a corresponding forward induction argument recommends. As we
have seen, given common knowledge of the game and of rationality,
forward induction reasoning can lead the agents to an apparent
contradiction: The classical argument for backwards induction is
predicated on what agents predict they would do at nodes in the tree
that are never reached. They make these predictions based upon their
common knowledge of the game and of rationality. But forward induction
reasoning seems to imply that if any off-equilibrium node had been
reached, common knowledge of rationality and the game must have
failed, so how could the agents have predicted what would happen at
these nodes?
3.5 Communication Networks
Situations in which a member of a population \(P\) is willing to
engage in a certain course of action provided that a large enough
portion of \(P\) engages in some appropriate behavior are typical
problems of
collective action
. Consider the case of an agent
who is debating whether to join a revolt. Her decision to join or not
to join will depend on the number of other agents whom she expects to
join the revolt. If such a number is too low, she will prefer not to
revolt, while if the number is sufficiently large, she will prefer to
revolt. Michael Chwe proposes a model where such a situation is
modeled game-theoretically. Players’ knowledge about other
players’ intentions depends on a
social network
in
which players are located. The individual ‘thresholds’ for
each player (the number of other agents that are needed for that
specific player to revolt) are only known by the immediate neighbors
in the network. Besides the intrinsic value of the results obtained by
Chwe’s analysis regarding the subject of collective action, his
model also provides insights about both the relation between social
networks and common knowledge and about the role of common knowledge
in collective action. For example, in some situations, first-order
knowledge of other agents’ personal thresholds is not sufficient
to motivate an agent to take action, whereas higher-order knowledge
or, in the limit, common knowledge is.
We present Chwe’s model following (Chwe 1999) and (Chwe 2000).
Suppose there is a group \(P\) of \(n\) people, and each agent has two
strategies: \(r\) (revolt, that is participating in the collective
action) and \(s\) (stay home and not participate). Each agent has her
own individual
threshold
\(\theta \in \{1, 2,\ldots, n+1\}\)
and she prefers \(r\) over \(s\) if and only if the total number of
players who revolt is greater than or equal to her threshold. An agent
with threshold 1 always revolts; an agent with threshold 2 revolts
only if another agent does; an agent with threshold \(n\) revolts only
if all agents do; an agent with threshold \(n+1\) never revolts, etc.
The agents are located in a social network, represented by a binary
relation \(\rightarrow\) over \(P\). The intended meaning of \(i
\rightarrow j\) is that agent \(i\) ‘talks’ to agent
\(j\), that is to say, agent \(i\)
knows
the threshold of
agent \(j.\) If we define \(B(i)\) to be the set \(\{j \in P : j
\rightarrow i\},\) we can interpret \(B(i)\) as \(i\)’s
‘neighborhood’ and say that, in general, \(i\) knows the
thresholds of all agents in her neighborhood. A further assumption is
that, for all \(j,k \in B(i),\) \(i\) knows whether \(j \rightarrow
k\) or not, that is, every agent knows whether her neighbors are
communicating with each other. The relation \(\rightarrow\) is taken
to be reflexive (one knows her own threshold).
Players’ knowledge is represented as usual in a possible worlds
framework. Consider for example the case in which there are two
agents, both with one of thresholds 1, 2 or 3. There are nine possible
worlds represented by ordered pairs of numbers, representing the first
and second player’s individual thresholds respectively: 11, 12,
13,…, 32, 33. If the players do not communicate, each knows her
own threshold only. Player 1’s information partition reflects
her ignorance about player’s 2 threshold and it consists of the
sets \(\{11, 12, 13\},\) \(\{21, 22, 23\},\) \(\{31, 32, 33\};\)
whereas, similarly, player 2’s partition consists of the sets
\(\{11, 21, 31\},\) \(\{12, 22, 32\},\) \(\{13, 23, 33\}.\) If player
1’s threshold is 1, she revolts no matter what player 2’s
threshold is. Hence, player 1 revolts in \(\{11, 12, 13\}\). If player
1’s threshold is 3, she never revolts. Hence, she plays \(s\) in
\(\{31, 32, 33\}\). If her threshold is 2, she revolts only if the
other player revolts as well. Since in this example we are assuming
that there is no communication between the agents, player 1 cannot be
sure of player’s 2 action, and chooses the non-risky \(s\) in
\(\{21, 22, 23\}\) as well. Similarly, player 2 plays \(r\) in \(\{11,
21, 31\}\) and \(s\) otherwise. Consider now the case in which \(1
\rightarrow 2\) and \(2 \rightarrow 1\). Both players have now the
finest information partitions. Thresholds of 1 and 3 yield \(r\) and
\(s\), respectively, for both players again. However, in player
1’s cells \(\{21\}\) and \(\{22\}\), she knows that player 2
will revolt, and, having threshold 2, she revolts as well. Similarly
for player 2 in his cells \(\{12\}\) and \(\{22\}\). Note, that the
case in which both players have threshold 2, yields both the
equilibrium in which both players revolt and the equilibrium in which
each player stays home. It is assumed that in the case of multiple
equilibria, the one which results in the most revolt will obtain.
Figure 3.5
The analysis of the example above applies to general networks with
\(n\) agents. Consider for example the three person network \(1
\rightarrow 2, 2 \rightarrow 1, 2 \rightarrow 3\), represented in
figure 3.5a (notice that symmetric links are represented by a line
without arrowheads) and assume that each player has threshold 2. The
network between players 1 and 2 is the same as the one above, hence if
they have threshold 2, they both revolt regardless of the threshold of
player 3. Player 3, on the other hand, knows her own threshold and
player 2’s. Hence, if they all have threshold 2, she cannot
distinguish between the possibilities in the set \(\{122, 222, 322,
422\}\). At 422, in particular, neither player 1 nor player 2 revolt,
hence player 3 cannot take the risk and does not revolt,
even
if
, in fact, she has a neighbor who revolts. Adding the link \(1
\rightarrow 3\) to the network (cf. figure 3.5b) we provide player 3
with knowledge about player 1’s action, hence in this case, if
they all have threshold 2, they all revolt. Notice that if we break
the link between players 1 and 2 (so that the network is \(1
\rightarrow 3\) and \(2 \rightarrow 3)\), player 3 knows that 1 and 2
cannot communicate and hence do not revolt at 222, therefore she
chooses \(s\) as well. Knowledge of what other players know about
other players is crucial.
Figure 3.6
The next example reveals that in some cases not even first-order
knowledge is sufficient to trigger action, and higher levels of
knowledge are necessary. Consider four players, each with threshold 3,
in the two different networks represented in figure 3.6
(‘square’, in figure 3.6a, and ‘kite’, in
figure 3.6b.) In the
square
network, player 1 knows that both
2 and 4 have threshold 3. However, she does not know about player
3’s threshold. If player 3 has threshold 5, then player 2 will
never revolt, since he does not know about player 4’s threshold
and it is then possible for him that player 4 has threshold 5 as well.
Player 1’s uncertainty about player 3 together with player
1’s knowledge of player 2’s uncertainty about player 4
force her not to revolt, although she has threshold 3 and two
neighbors with threshold 3 as well. Similar reasoning applies to all
other players, hence in the square no one revolts. Consider now the
kite
network. Player 4 ignores player 1’s and player
2’s thresholds, hence he does not revolt. However, player 1
knows that players 2 and 3 have threshold 3, that they know that they
do, and that they know that player 1 knows that they do. This is
enough to trigger action \(r\) for the three of them, and indeed if
players 1, 2 and 3 all revolt in all states in \(\{3331, 3332, 3333,
3334, 3335\}\), this is an equilibrium since in all states at least
three people revolt each with threshold three.
The difference between the square and the kite networks is that,
although in the square enough agents are willing to revolt for a
revolt to actually take place, and they all individually know this, no
agent knows that others know it. In the kite, on the other hand,
agents in the triangle not only know that there are three agents with
threshold 3, but they also know that they all know it, know that they
all know that they all know it, and so on. There is common knowledge
of such fact among them. It is interesting to notice that in
Chwe’s model, common knowledge obtains without there been a
publicly known
fact (cf. section 2.2). The proposition
“players 1, 2 and 3 all have threshold 3” (semantically:
the event \(\{3331, 3332, 3333, 3334, 3335\})\) is known by players 1,
2 and 3 because of the network structure, and becomes common knowledge
because the network structure is known by the players. To be sure, the
network structure is not just simply known, but it is actually
commonly known by the players. Player 1, for example, does not only
know that players 2 and 3 communicate with each other. She also knows
that players 2 and 3 know that she knows that they communicate with
each other, and so on.
In
complete
networks (networks in which all players
communicate with everyone else, as within the triangle in the kite
network) the information partitions of the players coincide, and they
are the finest partitions of the set of possible worlds. Hence, if
players have sufficiently low thresholds, such fact is commonly known
and there is an equilibrium in which all players revolt.
Definition 3.13
We say that \(\rightarrow\) is a
sufficient network
if there
is an equilibrium such that all players choose to revolt.
For a game in which all players have sufficiently low thresholds, the
complete network is clearly sufficient. Is the complete network
necessary to obtain an equilibrium in which all players revolt? It
turns out that it is not. A crucial role is played by structures of
the same kind as the ‘triangle’ group in the kite network,
called
cliques
. In such structures, ‘local’
common knowledge (that is, limited to the players part of the
structure) arises naturally. In a complete network (that is, a network
in which there is sufficient but not superfluous communication for it
to fully revolt) in which cliques cover the entire population, if one
clique speaks to another then every member of that clique speaks to
every member of the other clique. Moreover, for every two cliques such
that one is talking to the other, there exists a ‘chain’
of cliques with a starting element. In other words, every pair of
cliques in the relation are part of a chain (of length at least 2)
with a starting element (a
leading
clique.) Revolt propagates
in the network moving from ‘leading adopters’ to
‘followers’, according to the
social role
hierarchy
defined by the cliques and their relation. Consider the
following example, in which cliques are represented by circles and
numbers represent the thresholds of individual players:
Figure 3.7
Here the threshold 3 clique is the leading clique, igniting revolt in
the threshold 5 follower clique. In turn, the clique of a single
threshold 3 element follows. Notice that although she does not need to
know that the leading clique actually revolts to be willing to revolt,
that information is needed to ensure that the threshold 5 clique does
revolt, and hence that it is safe for her to join the revolt. While in
each clique information about thresholds and hence willingness to
revolt is common knowledge, in a chain of cliques information is
‘linear’; each clique knows about the clique of which it
is a follower, but does not know about earlier cliques.
Analyzing Chwe’s models for collective action under the respect
of weak versus strong links (cf. both Chwe 1999 and Chwe 2000)
provides further insights about the interaction between communication
networks and common knowledge. A strong link, roughly speaking, joins
close friends, whereas a weak link joins acquaintances. Strong links
tend to increase more slowly than weak ones, since people have common
close friends more often than they share acquaintances. In terms of
spreading information and connecting society, then, weak links do a
better job than strong links, since they traverse society more quickly
and have therefore larger reach. What role do strong and weak links
play in collective action? In Chwe’s dynamic analysis, strong
links fare better when thresholds are low, whereas weak links are
better when players’ thresholds are higher. Intuitively, one
sees that strong links tend to form small cliques right away (because
of the symmetry intrinsic in them: my friends’ friends tend to
be my friends as well); common knowledge arises quickly at the local
level and, if thresholds are low, there is a better chance that a
group tied by a strong link becomes a leading clique initiating
revolt. If, on the other hand, thresholds are high, local common
knowledge in small cliques is fruitless, and weak links, reaching
further distances more quickly, speed up communication and building of
the large cliques needed to sparkle collective action. Such
considerations shed some light on the relation between social networks
and common knowledge. While it is true that knowledge spreads faster
in networks in which weak links predominate, higher-order knowledge
(and, hence, common knowledge) tends to arise more slowly in this kind
of networks. Networks with a larger number of strong links, on the
other hand, facilitate the formation of common knowledge at the local
level.
4. Is Common Knowledge Attainable?
Lewis formulated an account of common knowledge which generates the
hierarchy of ‘\(i\) knows that \(j\) knows that … \(k\)
knows that \(A\)’ propositions in order to ensure that in his
account of convention, agents have correct beliefs about each other.
But since human agents obviously cannot reason their way through such
an infinite hierarchy, it is natural to wonder whether any group of
people can have full common knowledge of any proposition. More
broadly, the analyses of common knowledge reviewed in §3 would be
of little worth to social scientists and philosophers if this common
knowledge lies beyond the reach of human agents.
Fortunately for Lewis’ program, there are strong arguments that
common knowledge is indeed attainable. Lewis (1969) argues that the
common knowledge hierarchy should be viewed as a chain of
implications, and not as steps in anyone’s actual reasoning. He
gives informal arguments that the common knowledge hierarchy is
generated from a finite set of axioms. We saw in §2 that it is
possible to formulate Lewis’ axioms precisely and to derive the
common knowledge hierarchy from these axioms and a
public
event
functioning as a basis for common knowledge. Again, the
basic idea behind Lewis’ argument is that for a set of agents,
if a proposition \(A\) is publicly known among them and each agent
knows that everyone can draw the same conclusion \(p\) from \(A\) that
she can, then \(p\) is common knowledge. These conditions are
obviously context dependent, just as an individual’s knowing or
not knowing a proposition is context dependent. Yet there are many
cases where it is natural to assume that a public event generates
common knowledge, because it is properly broadcast, agents in the
group are in ideal conditions to perceive it, the inference from the
public event to the object of common knowledge is immediate, etc.
However, common knowledge could fail if some of the people failed to
perceive the public event, or if some of them believed that some of
the others could not understand the announcement, or hear it, or could
not draw the necessary inferences, and so on.
In fact, skeptical doubt about the attainability of common knowledge
is certainly possible. A strong skeptical argument has been recently
put forth by Lederman (2018b). Lederman builds an argument meant to
undermine the possibility of deriving the common knowledge hierarchy,
as done in §2, on the basis of a public event or, as Lederman
calls it,
public information
. The principle that Lederman
targets is what he calls
ideal common knowledge
(or belief),
that is: If \(p\) is public information in a group \(G\) then \(p\) is
common knowledge in \(G\), provided the agents in \(G\) are ideal
reasoners. The argument rests on the privacy and interpersonal
incomparability of mental states among agents, and although it is
offered in terms of perceptual knowledge, its scope goes beyond
perception to question the possibility of common knowledge tout
court.
Lederman (2018b) uses the following scenario: Two contestants, Alice
and Bob, observe the height of the mast of a toy sailboat (100 cm)
that is subsequently replaced with a randomly selected sailboat whose
mast may be more or less tall than 100 cm. As a matter of fact, the
mast of the selected boat is 300 cm tall. It is therefore public
information that the mast is taller than 100 cm. The
ideal common
knowledge
principle above, along with assumptions about Alice and
Bob’s visual systems and their publicity, would entail that
Alice and Bob have common knowledge that the mast is taller than 100
cm, and yet Lederman’s argument shows that they do not. The main
idea is that there is some degree of approximation in how humans
perceive, among other things, heights. Thus, for Alice it is
epistemically compatible with the mast looking 300 cm tall to her,
that the mast looks somewhat shorter than 300 cm to Bob, say 299 cm.
Also, Alice knows that if the mast looks 299 cm tall to Bob, then it
is epistemically compatible for him that the mast looks 298 cm tall to
Alice. Also, Bob knows that Alice knows that if the mast looks 298 cm
tall to Alice, then it is epistemically compatible for her that the
mast looks 297 cm tall to Bob. The reasoning can be repeated until
there it is epistemically compatible for Alice and Bob that the mast
is not taller than 100 cm, against the intuition that they have common
knowledge that the mast is over 100 cm tall!
Lederman (2018b) generalizes the argument to arbitrary cases and
sources of public information, to conclude that people never achieve
common knowledge or belief. In his view, the unattainability of common
knowledge is not a concern in terms of a possible loss of explanatory
power for social behavior. While common knowledge and public
information from which it proceeds have long been considered crucial
for coordinating behavior, Lederman claims that in fact coordination
requires neither (see the discussion of Lederman 2018a in the next
section.) Against Lederman, Immerman (2021) argues that the skeptical
argument sketched here fails in a large set of circumstances, and
hence fails to prove the unattainability of common knowledge. The key
idea in Immerman’s attempt to refute Lederman’s argument
is that there are many perceptual values that agents will not
entertain to begin with, as if, in the original sailboat example, they
knew that all masts within 100 and 300 cm tall had been stolen.
According to Immerman, cases of such “knowledge of gaps”
are not at all uncommon and their availability prevents
Lederman’s argument to go through.
Even if one were to reject Lederman’s skeptical argument (be it
by agreeing with Immerman’s argument above, or with the argument
by Thomason (2021) addressed in the next section, or otherwise), care
must be taken in ascribing common knowledge to a group of human
agents. Common knowledge is a phenomenon highly sensitive to the
agents’ circumstances. The following section gives an example
that shows that in order for \(A\) to be a common truism for a set of
agents, they ordinarily must perceive an event which implies \(A\)
simultaneously
and
publicly.
5. Coordination and Common \(p\)-Belief
In certain contexts, agents might not be able to achieve common
knowledge. The skeptical argument put forth by Lederman (2018b),
indeed, rests on and generalizes related arguments about the
attainability of common knowledge that were made in theoretical
computer science in relation to the
coordinated attack
problem (see Lederman 2018a, Halpern and Moses, 1990 and Fagin et al.
1995, esp. chapters 6 and 11). In the context of distributed systems,
using the formal systems of epistemic logic that, as mentioned above,
are equivalent to the semantic approach privileged by economists, it
can be proven formally that (i) common knowledge is necessary for
coordination and that (ii) the attainability of common knowledge
depends on assumptions made about the system. In particular,
asynchronous systems do not allow for common knowledge of a
communicated message to arise, making coordination impossible. Might
the agents achieve something “close” to common knowledge?
There are various weakenings of the notion of common knowledge that
can be of use: \(\varepsilon\)-common knowledge (agents will achieve
common knowledge within time \(\varepsilon\), hence they will
coordinate within time \(\varepsilon)\), eventual common knowledge
(agents will achieve common knowledge and therefore coordinate
eventually), probabilistic common knowledge (agents will achieve
probability \(p\) common belief, and hence with probability \(p\)
successfully coordinate), etc. Such weakenings of the notion of common
knowledge might prove useful depending on the intended
application.
Another weakening of common knowledge to consider is of course
\(m\)
th
level mutual knowledge. For a high value of \(m,
\mathbf{K}^m_N(A)\) might seem a good approximation of
\(\mathbf{K}^{*}_N(A)\). However, point (i) above maintains that no
arbitrary high value of \(m\) will help for instance with the
practical task of achieving coordination, so that the full force of
common knowledge is needed. We illustrate the point through the
following example, due to Rubinstein (1989, 1992), showing that simply
truncating the common knowledge hierarchy at any finite level can lead
agents to behave as if they had no mutual knowledge at
 all.

5.1 The E-mail Coordination Example
Lizzi and Joanna are faced with the coordination problem summarized in
the following figure:
Joanna
\(A\)
\(B\)
Lizzi
\(A\)
(2,2)
(0,−4)
\(B\)
(−4,0)
(0,0)
Figure 5.1a
\(\quad\omega_1,
\mu(\omega_1)=0.51\)
Joanna
\(A\)
\(B\)
Lizzi
\(A\)
(2,2)
(0,−4)
\(B\)
(−4,0)
(0,0)
Figure 5.1b
\(\quad\omega_2,
\mu(\omega_2)=0.49\)
In Figure 5.1, the payoffs are dependent upon a pair of possible
worlds. World \(\omega_1\) occurs with probability \(\mu(\omega_1) =
.51,\) while \(\omega_2\) occurs with probability \(\mu(\omega_2) =
.49.\) Hence, they coordinate with complete success by both choosing
\(A(B)\) only if the state of the world is \(\omega_1(\omega_2)\).
Suppose that Lizzi can observe the state of the world, but Joanna
cannot. We can interpret this game as follows: Joanna and Lizzi would
like to have a dinner together prepared by Aldo, their favorite chef.
Aldo alternates between \(A\) and \(B\), the two branches of Sorriso,
their favorite restaurant. State \(\omega_i\) is Aldo’s location
that day. At state \(\omega_1 (\omega_2)\), Aldo is at \(A (B)\).
Lizzi, who is on Sorriso’s special mailing list, receives notice
of \(\omega_i\). Lizzi’s and Joanna’s best outcome occurs
when they meet where Aldo is working, so they can have their planned
dinner. If they meet but miss Aldo, they are disappointed and do not
have dinner after all. If either goes to \(A\) and finds herself
alone, then she is again disappointed and does not have dinner. But
what each really wants to avoid is going to \(B\) if the other goes to
\(A\). If either of them arrives at \(B\) alone, she not only misses
dinner but must pay the exorbitant parking fee of the hotel which
houses \(B\), since the headwaiter of \(B\) refuses to validate the
parking ticket of anyone who asks for a table for two and then sits
alone. This is what Harsanyi (1967) terms a game of
incomplete
information
, since the game’s payoffs depend upon states
which not all the agents know.
\(A\) is a “play-it-safe” strategy for both Joanna and
 Lizzi.
[
33
]
By choosing \(A\) whatever the state of the world happens to be, the
agents run the risk that they will fail to get the positive payoff of
meeting where Aldo is, but each is also sure to avoid the really bad
consequence of choosing \(B\) if the other chooses \(A\). And since
only Lizzi knows the state of the world, neither can use information
regarding the state of the world to improve their prospects for
coordination. For Joanna has no such information, and since Lizzi
knows this, she knows that Joanna has to choose accordingly, so Lizzi
must choose her best response to the move she anticipates Joanna to
make regardless of the state of the world Lizzi observes. Apparently
Lizzi and Joanna cannot achieve expected payoffs greater than 1.02 for
each, their expected payoffs if they choose \((A, A)\) at either state
of the world.
If the state \(\omega\) were common knowledge, then the conditional
strategy profile \((A, A)\) if \(\omega = \omega_1\) and \((B, B)\),
if \(\omega = \omega_2\) would be a strict Nash equilibrium at which
each would achieve a payoff of 2. So the obvious remedy to their
predicament would be for Lizzi to tell Joanna Aldo’s location in
a face-to-face or telephone conversation and for them to agree to go
where Aldo is, which would make the state \(\omega\) and their
intentions to coordinate on the best outcome given \(\omega\) common
knowledge between them. Suppose for some reason they cannot talk to
each other, but they prearrange that Lizzi will send Joanna an e-mail
message if, and only if, \(\omega_2\) occurs. Suppose further that
Joanna’s and Lizzi’s e-mail systems are set up to send a
reply message automatically to the sender of any message received and
viewed, and that due to technical problems there is a small
probability, \(\varepsilon \gt 0\), that any message can fail to
arrive at its destination. Then if Lizzi sends Joanna a message, and
receives an automatic confirmation, then Lizzi knows that Joanna knows
that \(\omega_2\) has occurred. If Joanna receives an automatic
confirmation of Lizzi’s automatic confirmation, then Joanna
knows that Lizzi knows that Joanna knows that \(\omega_2\) occurred,
and so on. That \(\omega_2\) has occurred would become common
knowledge if each agent received infinitely many automatic
confirmations, assuming that all the confirmations could be sent and
received in a finite amount of
 time.
[
34
]
However, because of the probability \(\varepsilon\) of transmission
failure at every stage of communication, the sequence of confirmations
stops after finitely many stages with probability one. With
probability one, therefore, the agents fail to achieve full common
knowledge. But they do at least achieve something “close”
to common knowledge. Does this imply that they have good prospects of
settling upon \((B, B)\)?
Rubinstein shows by induction that if the number of automatically
exchanged confirmation messages is finite, then \(A\) is the only
choice that maximizes expected utility for each agent, given what she
knows about what they both know.
Rubinstein’s Proof
So even if agents have “almost” common knowledge, in the
sense that the number of levels of knowledge in “Joanna knows
that Lizzi knows that … that Joanna knows that \(\omega_2\)
occurred” is very large, their behavior is quite different from
their behavior given common knowledge that \(\omega_2\) has occurred.
Indeed, as Rubinstein points out, given merely “almost”
common knowledge, the agents choose as if no communication had
occurred at all! Rubinstein also notes that this result violates our
intuitions about what we would expect the agents to do in this case.
(See Rubinstein 1992, p. 324.) If \(T_i = 17\), wouldn’t we
expect agent \(i\) to choose \(B\)? Indeed, in many actual situations
we might think it plausible that the agents would each expect the
other to choose \(B\) even if \(T_1 = T_2 = 2\), which is all that is
needed for Lizzi to know that Joanna has received her original message
and for Joanna to know that Lizzi knows this! Binmore and Samelson
(2001) in fact show that if Joanna and Lizzi incur a cost when paying
attention to the messages they exchange, or if sending a message is
costly, then longer streams of messages are not paid attention to or
do not occur, respectively.
Lederman (2018a) proposes a radical solution to the paradoxes. In the
case of the coordinated attack, he argues that
rational
generals who commonly know that they are rational will attack if (and
only if) they have common knowledge that they will attack; since
common knowledge is not attainable by exchanging messages, they will
not attack. However, admitting that the generals do not commonly
believe that they are rational, a simple model can be built showing
that such generals do attack without common knowledge that they will.
Similarly, in the case of the e-mail game, he shows that if players
can be of an irrational type (so that she chooses game \(B\) even if
her expected payoff is lower than for choosing game \(A\),) and one
player believes with sufficiently high probability that the other
player is of the irrational type, then players can coordinate on game
\(B\) after a finite number of messages have been exchanged. Thus,
Lederman (2018a) argues that we should take common knowledge of
rationality to be a simplifying assumption, useful to produce
tractable mathematical models and yet generally false “in the
wild,” where a commonsense notion of rationality does let
generals and laymen easily coordinate after a small number of message
exchanges. Thomason (2021) takes issue with Lederman’s use of
the notion of commonsense rationality, and argues about the importance
of considering instead the cognitive and deliberative processes that
lead to the emergence of both individual and commonly held attitudes.
Despite their disagreement, both Lederman (2018a, 2018b) and Thomason
(2021) emphasize the importance of the relation between (commonly)
held beliefs or knowledge and practical reasoning. An interesting
application of practical issues pertaining to the attainability of
common knowledge is offered in Halpern and Pass (2017), where a
blockchain protocol (and consensus and hence coordination therein) is
analyzed in terms of suitable weakenings of the notion of common
 knowledge.
[
35
]
5.2 Common \(p\)-Belief
The example in Section 5.1 hints that mutual knowledge is not the only
weakening of common knowledge that is relevant to coordination.
Brandenburger and Dekel (1987) and Monderer and Samet (1989)
explore another option, which is to weaken the properties of the
\(\mathbf{K}^{*}_N\) operator. Monderer and Samet motivate this
approach by noting that even if a mutual knowledge hierarchy stops at
a certain level, agents might still have higher level mutual
beliefs
about the proposition in question. So they replace
the knowledge operator \(\mathbf{K}_i\) with a
belief
operator
\(\mathbf{B}^p_i\):
Definition 5.1
If \(\mu_i(\cdot)\) is agent \(i\)’s probability distribution
over \(\Omega\), then
\[
\mathbf{B}^p_i(A) = \{\omega \mid \mu_i (A \mid \mathcal{H}_i (\omega)) \ge p \}
\]
\(\mathbf{B}^p_i(A)\) is to be read ‘\(i\) believes \(A\) (given
\(i\)’s private information) with probability at least \(p\) at
\(\omega\)’, or ‘\(i\) \(p\)-believes \(A\)’. The
belief operator \(\mathbf{B}^p_i\) satisfies axioms K2, K3, and K4 of
the knowledge operator. \(\mathbf{B}^p_i\) does not satisfy K1, but
does satisfy the weaker property
\[
\mu_i (A \mid \mathbf{B}^p_i(A)) \ge p
\]
that is, if one believes \(A\) with probability at least \(p\), then
the probability of \(A\) is indeed at least \(p\).
One can define
mutual
and
common p-beliefs
recursively in a manner similar to the definition of mutual and common
knowledge:
Definition 5.2
Let a set \(\Omega\) of possible worlds together with a set of agents
\(N\) be given.
(1) The proposition that \(A\) is
(first level or first order)
mutual
p-belief for the agents of \(N, \mathbf{B}^p_{N^1}(A),\)
is the set defined by
\[
\mathbf{B}^p_{N^1}(A) \equiv \bigcap_{i\in N} \mathbf{B}^p_i(A).
\]
(2) The proposition that \(A\) is \(m\)
th
level
(or \(m\)
th
order
)
mutual
\(p\)-belief
among the agents of \(N, \mathbf{B}^p_{N^m}(A),\) is defined
recursively as the set
\[
\mathbf{B}^p_{N^m}(A) \equiv \bigcap_{i\in N} \mathbf{B}^p_i (\mathbf{B}^p_{N^{m-1}}(A))
\]
(3) The proposition that \(A\) is
common p-belief
among the
agents of \(N, \mathbf{B}^p_{N^*}(A),\) is defined as the set
\[
\mathbf{B}^p_{N^*}(A) \equiv \bigcap_{m=1}^{\infty} \mathbf{B}^p_{N^m}(A).
\]
If \(A\) is common (or \(m\)
th
level mutual) knowledge at
world \(\omega\), then \(A\) is common \((m\)
th
level)
\(p\)-belief at \(\omega\) for every value of \(p\). So mutual and
common \(p\)-beliefs formally generalize the mutual and common
knowledge concepts. However, note that \(\mathbf{B}^1_{N^*}(A)\) is
not necessarily the same proposition as \(\mathbf{K}^{*}_N (A)\), that
is, even if \(A\) is common 1-belief, \(A\) can fail to be common
knowledge.
Common \(p\)-belief forms a hierarchy similar to a common knowledge
hierarchy:
Proposition 5.3
\(\omega \in \mathbf{B}^{p}_{N^m}(A)\) iff
(∗) For all agents \(i_1, i_2 , \ldots ,i_m \in N,\) \(\omega
\in \mathbf{B}^{p}_{i_1}\mathbf{B}^p_{i_2} \ldots
\mathbf{B}^p_{i_m}(A)\)
Hence, \(\omega \in \mathbf{B}^{p}_{N^*}(A)\) iff (∗) is the
case for each \(m \ge 1.\)
Proof
. Similar to the
Proof of Proposition 2.5
.
One can draw several morals from the e-mail game of Example 5.1.
Rubinstein (1987) argues that his conclusion seems paradoxical for the
same reason the backwards induction solution of Alan’s and
Fiona’s perfect information game might seem paradoxical:
Mathematical induction does not appear to be part of our
“everyday” reasoning. This game also shows that in order
for A to be a common truism for a set of agents, they ordinarily must
perceive an event which implies A
simultaneously
in each
others’ presence. A third moral is that in some cases, it may
make sense for the agents to employ some solution concept weaker than
Nash or correlated equilibrium. In their analysis of the e-mail game,
Monderer and Samet (1989) introduce the notions of
ex ante
and
ex post \(\varepsilon\)-equilibrium.
An
ex ante
equilibrium \(h\) is a system of strategy profiles such that no agent
\(i\) expects to gain more than \(\varepsilon\)-utiles if \(i\)
deviates from \(h\). An
ex post
equilibrium \(h'\) is a
system of strategy profiles such that no agent \(i\) expects to gain
more than \(\varepsilon\)-utiles by deviating from \(h'\) given
\(i\)’s private information. When \(\varepsilon = 0\), these
concepts coincide, and \(h\) is a Nash equilibrium. Monderer and Samet
show that, while the agents in the e-mail game can never achieve
common knowledge of the world \(\omega\), if they have common
\(p\)-belief of \(\omega\) for sufficiently high \(p\), then there is
an
ex ante
equilibrium at which they follow \((A,A)\) if
\(\omega = \omega_1\) and \((B,B)\), if \(\omega = \omega_2\). This
equilibrium turns out not to be
ex post.
However, if the
situation is changed so that there are no replies, then Lizzi and
Joanna could have at most first order mutual knowledge that \(\omega =
\omega_2\). Monderer and Samet show that in this situation, given
sufficiently high common \(p\)-belief that \(\omega = \omega_2\),
there is an
ex post
equilibrium at which Joanna and Lizzi
choose \((B,B)\) if \(\omega = \omega_2\)! So another way one might
view this third moral of the e-mail game is that agents’
prospects for coordination can sometimes improve dramatically if they
rely on their common beliefs as well as their mutual knowledge. More
recently, the notion of \(p\)-belief and \(p\)-common belief proved
useful (Paternotte, 2011) to analyze and formalize Lewis’s
account of common knowledge, while Paternotte (2017), establishing a
link between “ordinary” common knowledge and \(p\)-common
belief, uses the latter to show that only a limited number of
exchanges in the e-mail game or coordinated attack paradox would be
sufficient to determine coordination. The result, building on
foundations provided by Leitgeb (2014), is used to show that our
“ordinary” understanding of common knowledge is captured
by probabilistic common belief, although at the price of decreased
robustness relative to the number of individuals sharing common belief
and their awareness.
Bibliography
Annotations
Lewis (1969) is the classic pioneering study of common knowledge and
its potential applications to conventions and game theory. As Lewis
acknowledges, parts of his work are foreshadowed in Hume (1740) and
Schelling (1960).
Aumann (1976) gives the first mathematically rigorous formulation of
common knowledge using set theory. Schiffer (1972) uses the formal
vocabulary of
epistemic logic
(Hintikka 1962) to state his
definition of common knowledge. Schiffer’s general approach is
to augment a system of sentential logic with a set of knowledge
operators corresponding to a set of agents, and then to define common
knowledge as a hierarchy of propositions in the augmented system.
Bacharach (1992), Bicchieri (1993) and Fagin,
et al
. (1995)
adopt this approach, and develop logical theories of common knowledge
which include soundness and completeness theorems. Fagin, et al. show
that the syntactic and set-theoretic approaches to developing common
knowledge are logically equivalent.
Aumann (1995) gives a recent defense of the classical view of
backwards induction in games of imperfect information. For criticisms
of the classical view, see Binmore (1987), Reny (1992), Bicchieri
(1989) and especially Bicchieri (1993). Brandenburger (1992) surveys
the known results connecting mutual and common knowledge to solution
concepts in game theory. For more in-depth survey articles on common
knowledge and its applications to game theory, see Binmore and
Brandenburger (1989), Geanakoplos (1994) and Dekel and Gul (1997). For
her alternate account of common knowledge along with an account of
conventions which opposes Lewis’ account, see Gilbert
(1989).
Monderer and Samet (1989) remains one of the best resources for the
study of common p-belief.

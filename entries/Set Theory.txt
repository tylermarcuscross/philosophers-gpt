Set Theory
First published Wed Oct 8, 2014; substantive revision Tue Jan 31, 2023
Set theory is the mathematical theory of well-determined collections,
called
sets
, of objects that are called
members
, or
elements
, of the set. Pure set theory deals exclusively with
sets, so the only sets under consideration are those whose members are
also sets. The theory of the
hereditarily-finite
sets, namely
those finite sets whose elements are also finite sets, the elements of
which are also finite, and so on, is formally equivalent to
arithmetic. So, the essence of set theory is the study of infinite
sets, and therefore it can be defined as the mathematical theory of
the actual—as opposed to potential—infinite.
The notion of set is so simple that it is usually introduced
informally, and regarded as self-evident. In set theory, however, as
is usual in mathematics, sets are given axiomatically, so their
existence and basic properties are postulated by the appropriate
formal axioms. The axioms of set theory imply the existence of a
set-theoretic universe so rich that all mathematical objects can be
construed as sets. Also, the formal language of pure set theory allows
one to formalize all mathematical notions and arguments. Thus, set
theory has become the standard foundation for mathematics, as every
mathematical object can be viewed as a set, and every theorem of
mathematics can be logically deduced in the Predicate Calculus from
the axioms of set theory.
Both aspects of set theory, namely, as the mathematical science of the
infinite, and as the foundation of mathematics, are of philosophical
importance.

1. The origins
Set theory, as a separate mathematical discipline, begins in the work
of Georg Cantor. One might say that set theory was born in late 1873,
when he made the amazing discovery that the linear continuum, that is,
the real line, is not countable, meaning that its points cannot be
counted using the natural numbers. So, even though the set of natural
numbers and the set of real numbers are both infinite, there are more
real numbers than there are natural numbers, which opened the door to
the investigation of the different sizes of infinity. See the entry on
the
early development of set theory
for a discussion of the origin of set-theoretic ideas and their use
by different mathematicians and philosophers before and around
Cantor’s time.
According to Cantor, two sets \(A\) and \(B\) have the same size, or
cardinality
, if they are bijectable, i.e., the elements of
\(A\) can be put in a one-to-one correspondence with the elements of
\(B\). Thus, the set \(\mathbb{N}\) of natural numbers and the set
\(\mathbb{R}\) of real numbers have different cardinalities. In 1878
Cantor formulated the famous
Continuum Hypothesis
(CH), which
asserts that every infinite set of real numbers is either countable,
i.e., it has the same cardinality as \(\mathbb{N}\), or has the same
cardinality as \(\mathbb{R}\). In other words, there are only two
possible sizes of infinite sets of real numbers. The CH is the most
famous problem of set theory. Cantor himself devoted much effort to
it, and so did many other leading mathematicians of the first half of
the twentieth century, such as Hilbert, who listed the CH as the first
problem in his celebrated list of 10 (later expanded to 23 in the
published version) unsolved mathematical problems presented in 1900 at
the Second International Congress of Mathematicians, in Paris. The
attempts to prove the CH led to major discoveries in set theory, such
as the theory of constructible sets, and the forcing technique, which
showed that the CH can neither be proved nor disproved from the usual
axioms of set theory. To this day, the CH remains open.
Early on, some inconsistencies, or paradoxes, arose from a naive use
of the notion of set; in particular, from the deceivingly natural
assumption that every property determines a set, namely the set of
objects that have the property. One example is
Russell’s
Paradox
, also known to Zermelo:
consider the property of sets of not being members of themselves. If
the property determines a set, call it \(A\), then \(A\) is a member
of itself if and only if \(A\) is not a member of itself.
Thus, some collections, like the collection of all sets, the
collection of all ordinals numbers, or the collection of all cardinal
numbers, are not sets. Such collections are called
proper
classes
.
In order to avoid the paradoxes and put it on a firm footing, set
theory had to be axiomatized. The first axiomatization was due to
Zermelo (1908) and it came as a result of the need to spell out the
basic set-theoretic principles underlying his proof of Cantor’s
Well-Ordering Principle. Zermelo’s axiomatization avoids
Russell’s Paradox by means of the Separation axiom, which is
formulated as quantifying over properties of sets, and thus it is a
second-order statement. Further work by Skolem and Fraenkel led to the
formalization of the Separation axiom in terms of formulas of
first-order, instead of the informal notion of property, as well as to
the introduction of the axiom of Replacement, which is also formulated
as an axiom schema for first-order formulas (see next section). The
axiom of Replacement is needed for a proper development of the theory
of transfinite ordinals and cardinals, using transfinite recursion
(see
Section 3
).
 It is also needed to prove the existence of such simple sets as the
set of hereditarily finite sets, i.e., those finite sets whose
elements are finite, the elements of which are also finite, and so on;
or to prove basic set-theoretic facts such as that every set is
contained in a transitive set, i.e., a set that contains all elements
of its elements (see Mathias 2001 for the weaknesses of Zermelo set
theory). A further addition, by von Neumann, of the axiom of
Foundation, led to the standard axiom system of set theory, known as
the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms plus the Axiom of Choice, or ZFC.
Other axiomatizations of set theory, such as those of von
Neumann-Bernays-Gödel (NBG), or Morse-Kelley (MK), allow also for
a formal treatment of proper classes.
2. The axioms of set theory
ZFC is an axiom system formulated in first-order logic with equality
and with only one binary relation symbol \(\in\) for membership. Thus,
we write \(A\in B\) to express that \(A\) is a member of the set
\(B\). See the
Supplement on Basic Set Theory
for further details. See also the
Supplement on Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory
for a formalized version of the axioms and further comments. We state
below the axioms of ZFC informally.
2.1 The axioms of ZFC
Extensionality
: If two sets \(A\) and \(B\) have the same
elements, then they are equal.
Null Set
: There exists a set, denoted by \({\varnothing}\)
and called the
empty set
, which has no elements.
Pair
: Given any sets \(A\) and \(B\), there exists a set,
denoted by \(\{ A,B\}\), which contains \(A\) and \(B\) as its only
elements. In particular, there exists the set \(\{ A\}\) which has
\(A\) as its only element.
Power Set
: For every set \(A\) there exists a set, denoted by
\(\mathcal{P}(A)\) and called the
power set
of \(A\), whose
elements are all the subsets of \(A\).
Union
: For every set \(A\), there exists a set, denoted by
\(\bigcup A\) and called the
union
of \(A\), whose elements
are all the elements of the elements of \(A\).
Infinity:
There exists an infinite set. In particular, there
exists a set \(Z\) that contains \({\varnothing}\) and such that if
\(A\in Z\), then \(\bigcup\{ A, \{ A\}\}\in Z\).
Separation
: For every set \(A\) and every given property,
there is a set containing exactly the elements of \(A\) that have that
property. A
property
is given by a formula \(\varphi\) of the
first-order language of set theory.
Thus, Separation is not a single axiom but an axiom schema, that is,
an infinite list of axioms, one for each formula \(\varphi\).
Replacement
: For every given
definable function
with
domain a set \(A\), there is a set whose elements are all the values
of the function.
Replacement is also an axiom schema, as definable functions are given
by formulas.
Foundation
: Every non-empty set \(A\) contains an
\(\in\)-minimal element, that is, an element such that no element of
\(A\) belongs to it.
These are the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, or ZF. The axioms
of Null Set and Pair follow from the other ZF axioms, so they may be
omitted. Also, Replacement implies Separation.
Finally, there is the Axiom of Choice (AC):
Choice:
For every set \(A\) of pairwise-disjoint non-empty
sets, there exists a set that contains exactly one element from each
set in \(A\).
The AC was, for a long time, a controversial axiom. On the one hand,
it is very useful and of wide use in mathematics. On the other hand,
it has rather unintuitive consequences, such as the Banach-Tarski
Paradox, which says that the unit ball can be partitioned into
finitely-many pieces, which can then be rearranged to form two unit
balls. The objections to the axiom arise from the fact that it asserts
the existence of sets that cannot be explicitly defined. But
Gödel’s 1938 proof of its consistency, relative to the
consistency of ZF, dispelled any suspicions left about it.
The Axiom of Choice is equivalent, modulo ZF, to the
Well-ordering
Principle
, which asserts that every set can be well-ordered,
i.e., it can be linearly ordered so that every non-empty subset has a
minimal element.
Although not formally necessary, besides the symbol \(\in\) one
normally uses for convenience other auxiliary defined symbols. For
example, \(A\subseteq B\) expresses that \(A\) is a
subset
of
\(B\), i.e., every member of \(A\) is a member of \(B\). Other symbols
are used to denote sets obtained by performing basic operations, such
as \(A\cup B\), which denotes the
union
of \(A\) and \(B\),
i.e., the set whose elements are those of \(A\) and \(B\); or \(A\cap
B\), which denotes the
intersection
of \(A\) and \(B\), i.e.,
the set whose elements are those common to \(A\) and \(B\). The
ordered pair
\((A,B)\) is defined as the set \(\{ \{ A\},\{
A,B\}\}\). Thus, two ordered pairs \((A,B)\) and \((C,D)\) are equal
if and only if \(A=C\) and \(B=D\). And the
Cartesian product
\(A\times B\) is defined as the set of all ordered pairs \((C,D)\)
such that \(C\in A\) and \(D\in B\). Given any formula
\(\varphi(x,y_1,\ldots ,y_n)\), and sets \(A,B_1,\ldots ,B_n\), by the
axiom of Separation one can form the set of all those elements of
\(A\) that satisfy the formula \(\varphi(x,B_1,\ldots ,B_n)\). This
set is denoted by \(\{ a\in A: \varphi(a,B_1,\ldots ,B_n)\}\). In ZF
one can easily prove that all these sets exist. See the
Supplement on Basic Set Theory
for further discussion.
3. The theory of transfinite ordinals and cardinals
In ZFC one can develop the Cantorian theory of transfinite (i.e.,
infinite) ordinal and cardinal numbers. Following the definition given
by Von Neumann in the early 1920s, the ordinal numbers, or
ordinals
, for short, are obtained by starting with the empty
set and performing two operations: taking the immediate successor, and
passing to the limit. Thus, the first ordinal number is
\({\varnothing}\). Given an ordinal \(\alpha\), its
immediate
successor
, denoted by \(\alpha +1\), is the set \(\alpha \cup \{
\alpha \}\). And given a non-empty set \(X\) of ordinals such that for
every \(\alpha \in X\) the successor \(\alpha +1\) is also in \(X\),
one obtains the
limit ordinal
\(\bigcup X\). One shows that
every ordinal is (strictly) well-ordered by \(\in\), i.e., it is
linearly ordered by \(\in\) and there is no infinite
\(\in\)-descending sequence. Also, every well-ordered set is
isomorphic to a unique ordinal, called its
order-type
.
Note that every ordinal is the set of its predecessors. However, the
class \(ON\) of all ordinals is not a set. Otherwise, \(ON\) would be
an ordinal greater than all the ordinals, which is impossible. The
first infinite ordinal, which is the set of all finite ordinals, is
denoted by the Greek letter omega (\(\omega\)). In ZFC, one identifies
the finite ordinals with the natural numbers. Thus,
\({\varnothing}=0\), \(\{ {\varnothing}\}=1\), \(\{ {\varnothing}, \{
{\varnothing}\}\}=2\), etc., hence \(\omega\) is just the set
\(\mathbb{N}\) of natural numbers.
One can extend the operations of addition and multiplication of
natural numbers to all the ordinals. For example, the ordinal \(\alpha
+\beta\) is the order-type of the well-ordering obtained by
concatenating a well-ordered set of order-type \(\alpha\) and a
well-ordered set of order-type \(\beta\). The sequence of ordinals,
well-ordered by \(\in\), starts as follows
0, 1, 2,…, \(n\),…, \(\omega\), \(\omega+1\),
\(\omega+2\),…, \(\omega +\omega\),…, \(\omega \cdot
n\), …, \(\omega \cdot \omega\),…, \(\omega^n\),
…, \(\omega^\omega\), …
The ordinals satisfy the principle of
transfinite induction
:
suppose that \(C\) is a class of ordinals such that whenever \(C\)
contains all ordinals \(\beta\) smaller than some ordinal \(\alpha\),
then \(\alpha\) is also in \(C\). Then the class \(C\) contains all
ordinals. Using transfinite induction one can prove in ZFC (and one
needs the axiom of Replacement) the important principle of
transfinite recursion
, which says that, given any definable
class-function \(G\) (namely a definable operation that takes any set
\(x\) to a set \(G(x)\)), one can define a class-function \(F\) with
domain the class \(ON\) of ordinals, such that \(F(\alpha)\) is the
value of the function \(G\) applied to the function \(F\) restricted
to \(\alpha\). One uses transfinite recursion, for example, in order
to define properly the arithmetical operations of addition, product,
and exponentiation on the ordinals.
Recall that an infinite set is
countable
if it is bijectable,
i.e., it can be put into a one-to-one correspondence, with \(\omega\).
All the ordinals displayed above are either finite or countable. But
the set of all finite and countable ordinals is also an ordinal,
called \(\omega_1\), and is not countable. Similarly, the set of all
ordinals that are bijectable with some ordinal less than or equal to
\(\omega_1\) is also an ordinal, called \(\omega_2\), and is not
bijectable with \(\omega_1\), and so on.
3.1 Cardinals
A
cardinal
is an ordinal that is not bijectable with any
smaller ordinal. Thus, every finite ordinal is a cardinal, and
\(\omega\), \(\omega_1\), \(\omega_2\), etc. are also cardinals. The
infinite cardinals are represented by the letter aleph (\(\aleph\)) of
the Hebrew alphabet, and their sequence is indexed by the ordinals. It
starts like this
\(\aleph_0\), \(\aleph_1\), \(\aleph_2\), …, \(\aleph_\omega\),
\(\aleph_{\omega +1}\), …, \(\aleph_{\omega +\omega}\),
…, \(\aleph_{\omega^2}\), …, \(\aleph_{\omega^\omega}\),
…, \(\aleph_{\omega_1}\), …, \(\aleph_{\omega_2}\),
…
Thus, \(\omega=\aleph_0\), \(\omega_1=\aleph_1\),
\(\omega_2=\aleph_2\), etc. For every cardinal there is a bigger one,
and the limit of an increasing sequence of cardinals is also a
cardinal. Thus, the class of all cardinals is not a set, but a proper
class.
An infinite cardinal \(\kappa\) is called
regular
if it is
not the union of less than \(\kappa\) smaller cardinals. Thus,
\(\aleph_0\) is regular, and so are all infinite successor cardinals,
such as \(\aleph_1\). Non-regular infinite cardinals are called
singular
. The first singular cardinal is \(\aleph_\omega\),
as it is the union of countably-many smaller cardinals, namely
\(\aleph_\omega =\bigcup \{\aleph_n : n<\omega\} \).
The
cofinality
of a cardinal \(\kappa\), denoted by
\(cf(\kappa)\) is the smallest cardinal \(\lambda\) such that
\(\kappa\) is the union of \(\lambda\)-many smaller ordinals. Thus,
\(cf(\aleph_\omega)=\aleph_0\).
By the AC (in the form of the Well-Ordering Principle), every set
\(A\) can be well-ordered, hence it is bijectable with a unique
cardinal, called the
cardinality
of \(A\). Given two
cardinals \(\kappa\) and \(\lambda\), the sum \(\kappa +\lambda\) is
defined as the cardinality of the set consisting of the union of any
two disjoint sets, one of cardinality \(\kappa\) and one of
cardinality \(\lambda\). And the product \(\kappa \cdot \lambda\) is
defined as the cardinality of the Cartesian product \(\kappa \times
\lambda\). The operations of sum and product of infinite cardinals are
trivial, for if \(\kappa\) and \(\lambda\) are infinite cardinals,
then \(\kappa +\lambda =\kappa \cdot \lambda = maximum \{ \kappa
,\lambda\}\).
In contrast, cardinal exponentiation is highly non-trivial, for even
the value of the simplest non-trivial infinite exponential, namely
\(2^{\aleph_0}\), is not known and cannot be determined in ZFC (see
below). The cardinal \(\kappa^\lambda\) is defined as the cardinality
of the Cartesian product of \(\lambda\) copies of \(\kappa\);
equivalently, as the cardinality of the set of all functions from
\(\lambda\) into \(\kappa\). König’s theorem asserts that
\(\kappa^{cf(\kappa)}>\kappa\), which implies that the cofinality
of the cardinal \(2^{\aleph_0}\), whatever that cardinal is, must be
uncountable. But this is essentially all that ZFC can prove about the
value of the exponential \(2^{\aleph_0}\).
In the case of exponentiation of singular cardinals, ZFC has a lot
more to say. In 1989, Shelah proved the remarkable result that if
\(\aleph_\omega\) is a strong limit, that is,
\(2^{\aleph_n}<\aleph_\omega\), for every \(n<\omega\), then
\(2^{\aleph_\omega}<\aleph_{\omega_4}\) (see Shelah (1994)). The
technique developed by Shelah to prove this and similar theorems, in
ZFC, is called
pcf theory
(for
possible
cofinalities
), and has found many applications in other areas of
mathematics.
4. The universe \(V\) of all sets
A posteriori
, the ZF axioms other than
Extensionality—which needs no justification because it just
states a defining property of sets—may be justified by their use
in building the
cumulative hierarchy of sets
. Namely, in ZF
we define using transfinite recursion the class-function that assigns
to each ordinal \(\alpha\) the set \(V_\alpha\), given as follows:
\(V_0={\varnothing}\)
\(V_{\alpha +1}=\mathcal{P}(V_\alpha)\)
\(V_\alpha =\bigcup \{ V_\beta : \beta <\alpha \}\), whenever
\(\alpha\) is a limit ordinal.
The Power Set axiom is used to obtain \(V_{\alpha +1}\) from
\(V_\alpha\). Replacement and Union allow one to form \(V_\alpha\) for
\(\alpha\) a limit ordinal. Indeed, consider the function that assigns
to each \(\beta <\alpha\) the set \(V_\beta\). By Replacement, the
collection of all the \(V_\beta\), for \(\beta <\alpha\), is a set,
hence the Union axiom applied to that set yields \(V_\alpha\). The
axiom of Infinity is needed to prove the existence of \(\omega\) and
hence of the transfinite sequence of ordinals. Finally, the axiom of
Foundation is equivalent, assuming the other axioms, to the statement
that every set belongs to some \(V_\alpha\), for some ordinal
\(\alpha\). Thus, ZF proves that the set theoretic universe, denoted
by \(V\), is the union of all the \(V_\alpha\), \(\alpha\) an
ordinal.
The proper class \(V\), together with the \(\in\) relation, satisfies
all the ZFC axioms, and is thus a model of ZFC. It is the intended
model of ZFC, and one may think of ZFC as providing a description of
\(V\), a description however that is highly incomplete, as we shall
see below.
One important property of \(V\) is the so-called
Reflection
Principle
. Namely, for each formula \(\varphi(x_1,\ldots ,x_n)\),
ZFC proves that there exists some \(V_\alpha\) that reflects it, that
is, for every \(a_1,\ldots,a_n\in V_\alpha\),
\(\varphi(a_1,\ldots ,a_n)\) holds in \(V\) if and only if
\(\varphi(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\) holds in \(V_\alpha\).
Thus, \(V\) cannot be characterized by any sentence, as any sentence
that is true in \(V\) must be also true in some initial segment
\(V_\alpha\). In particular, ZFC is not finitely axiomatizable, for
otherwise ZFC would prove that, for unboundedly many ordinals
\(\alpha\), \(V_\alpha\) is a model of ZFC, contradicting
Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem (see
Section 5.2
).
The Reflection Principle encapsulates the essence of ZF set theory,
for as shown by Levy (1960), the axioms of Extensionality, Separation,
and Foundation, together with the Reflection Principle, formulated as
the axiom schema asserting that each formula is reflected by some set
that contains all elements and all subsets of its elements (note that
the \(V_\alpha\) are like this), is equivalent to ZF.
5. Set theory as the foundation of mathematics
Every mathematical object may be viewed as a set. For example, the
natural numbers are identified with the finite ordinals, so
\(\mathbb{N}=\omega\). The set of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) may be
defined as the set of equivalence classes of pairs of natural numbers
under the equivalence relation \((n, m)\equiv (n',m')\) if and only if
\(n+m'=m+n'\). By identifying every natural number \(n\) with the
equivalence class of the pair \((n,0)\), one may extend naturally the
operations of sum and product of natural numbers to \(\mathbb{Z}\)
(see Enderton (1977) for details, and Levy (1979) for a different
construction). Further, one may define the rationals \(\mathbb{Q}\) as
the set of equivalence classes of pairs \((n,m)\) of integers, where
\(m\ne 0\), under the equivalence relation \((n,m)\equiv (n',m')\) if
and only if \(n\cdot m'=m\cdot n'\). Again, the operations \(+\) and
\(\cdot\) on \(\mathbb{Z}\) may be extended naturally to
\(\mathbb{Q}\). Moreover, the ordering \(\leq_{\mathbb{Q}}\) on the
rationals is given by: \(r \leq_{\mathbb{Q}} s\) if and only if there
exists \(t\in \mathbb{Q}\) such that \(s=r+t\). The real numbers may
be defined as Dedekind cuts of \(\mathbb{Q}\), namely, a real number
is given by a pair \((A,B)\) of non-empty disjoint sets such that
\(A\cup B=\mathbb{Q}\), \(A\) has no greatest element, and \(a
\lt_{\mathbb{Q}} b\) for every \(a\in A\) and \(b\in B\). One can then
extend again the operations of \(+\) and \(\cdot\) on \(\mathbb{Q}\),
as well as the ordering \(\leq_{\mathbb{Q}}\), to the set of real
numbers \(\mathbb{R}\).
Let us emphasize that it is not claimed that, e.g., real numbers
are
Dedekind cuts of rationals, as they could also be defined
using Cauchy sequences, or in other different ways. What is important,
from a foundational point of view, is that the set-theoretic version
of \(\mathbb{R}\), together with the usual algebraic operations,
satisfies the categorical axioms that the real numbers satisfy, namely
those of a complete ordered field. The metaphysical question of what
the real numbers really are is irrelevant here.
Algebraic structures can also be viewed as sets, as any \(n\)-ary
relation on the elements of a set \(A\) can be viewed as a set of
ordered \(n\)-tuples \((a_1,\ldots ,a_n)\) of elements of \(A\). And
any \(n\)-ary function \(f\) on \(A\), with values on some set \(B\),
can be seen as the set of ordered \(n+1\)-tuples \(((a_1,\ldots
,a_n),b)\) such that \(b\) is the value of \(f\) on \((a_1,\ldots
,a_m)\). Thus, for example, a
group
is just a triple \((A, +,
0)\), where \(A\) is a non-empty set, \(+\) is a binary function on
\(A\) that is associative, \(0\) is an element of \(A\) such that
\(a+0=0+a=a\), for all \(a\in A\), and for every \(a\in A\) there is
an element of \(A\), denoted by \(-a\), such that \(a+(-a)=(-a)+a=0\).
Also, a
topological space
is just a set \(X\) together with a
topology \(\tau\) on it, i.e., \(\tau\) is a subset of
\(\mathcal{P}(X)\) containing \(X\) and \({\varnothing}\), and closed
under arbitrary unions and finite intersections. Any mathematical
object whatsoever can always be viewed as a set, or a proper class.
The properties of the object can then be expressed in the language of
set theory. Any mathematical statement can be formalized into the
language of set theory, and any mathematical theorem can be derived,
using the calculus of first-order logic, from the axioms of ZFC, or
from some extension of ZFC. It is in this sense that set theory
provides a foundation for mathematics.
The foundational role of set theory for mathematics, while
significant, is by no means the only justification for its study. The
ideas and techniques developed within set theory, such as infinite
combinatorics, forcing, or the theory of large cardinals, have turned
it into a deep and fascinating mathematical theory, worthy of study by
itself, and with important applications to practically all areas of
mathematics.
5.1 Metamathematics
The remarkable fact that virtually all of mathematics can be
formalized within ZFC, makes possible a mathematical study of
mathematics itself. Thus, any questions about the existence of some
mathematical object, or the provability of a conjecture or hypothesis
can be given a mathematically precise formulation. This makes
metamathematics
possible, namely the mathematical study of
mathematics itself. So, the question about the provability or
unprovability of any given mathematical statement becomes a sensible
mathematical question. When faced with an open mathematical problem or
conjecture, it makes sense to ask for its provability or unprovability
in the ZFC formal system. Unfortunately, the answer may be neither,
because ZFC, if consistent, is incomplete.
5.2 The incompleteness phenomenon
Gödel’s completeness theorem for first-order logic implies
that ZFC is
consistent
—i.e., no contradiction can be
derived from it—if and only if it has a model. A
model
of ZFC is a pair \((M,E)\), where \(M\) is a non-empty set and \(E\)
is a binary relation on \(M\) such that all the axioms of ZFC are true
when interpreted in \((M,E)\), i.e., when the variables that appear in
the axioms range over elements of \(M\), and \(\in\) is interpreted as
\(E\). Thus, if \(\varphi\) is a sentence of the language of set
theory and one can find a model of ZFC in which \(\varphi\) holds,
then its negation \(\neg \varphi\) cannot be proved in ZFC. Hence, if
one can find a model of \(\varphi\) and also a model of \(\neg
\varphi\), then \(\varphi\) is neither provable nor disprovable in
ZFC, in which case we say that \(\varphi\) is
undecidable
in,
or
independent
of, ZFC.
In 1931, Gödel announced his striking incompleteness theorems,
which assert that any reasonable formal system for mathematics is
necessarily incomplete. In particular, if ZFC is consistent, then
there are propositions in the language of set theory that are
undecidable in ZFC. Moreover, Gödel’s second incompleteness
theorem implies that the formal (arithmetical) statement \(CON(ZFC)\),
which asserts that ZFC is consistent, while true, cannot be proved in
ZFC. And neither can its negation. Thus, \(CON(ZFC)\) is undecidable
in ZFC.
If ZFC is consistent, then it cannot prove the existence of a model of
ZFC, for otherwise ZFC would prove its own consistency. Thus, a proof
of consistency or of undecidability of a given sentence \(\varphi\) is
always a
relative consistency
proof. That is, one assumes
that ZFC is consistent, hence it has a model, and then one constructs
another model of ZFC where the sentence \(\varphi\) is true. We shall
see several examples in the next sections.
6. The set theory of the continuum
From Cantor and until about 1940, set theory developed mostly around
the study of the continuum, that is, the real line \(\mathbb{R}\). The
main topic was the study of the so-called regularity properties, as
well as other structural properties, of simply-definable sets of real
numbers, an area of mathematics that is known as
Descriptive Set
Theory
.
6.1 Descriptive Set Theory
Descriptive Set Theory is the study of the properties and structure of
definable sets of real numbers and, more generally, of definable
subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and other
Polish spaces
(i.e.,
topological spaces that are homeomorphic to a separable complete
metric space), such as the
Baire space
\(\mathcal{N}\) of all
functions \(f:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\), the space of complex
numbers, Hilbert space, and separable Banach spaces. The simplest sets
of real numbers are the basic open sets (i.e., the open intervals with
rational endpoints), and their complements. The sets that are obtained
in a countable number of steps by starting from the basic open sets
and applying the operations of taking the complement and forming a
countable union of previously obtained sets are the
Borel
sets
. All Borel sets are
regular
, that is, they enjoy
all the classical
regularity properties
. One example of a
regularity property is the
Lebesgue measurability
: a set of
reals is Lebesgue measurable if it differs from a Borel set by a null
set, namely, a set that can be covered by sets of basic open intervals
of arbitrarily-small total length. Thus, trivially, every Borel set is
Lebesgue measurable, but sets more complicated than the Borel ones may
not be. Other classical regularity properties are the
Baire
property
(a set of reals has the Baire property if it differs
from an open set by a meager set, namely, a set that is a countable
union of sets that are not dense in any interval), and the
perfect
set property
(a set of reals has the perfect set property if it
is either countable or contains a perfect set, namely, a nonempty
closed set with no isolated points). In ZFC one can prove that there
exist non-regular sets of reals, but the AC is necessary for this
(Solovay 1970).
The
analytic sets
, also called \(\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_1\), are
the continuous images of Borel sets. And the
co-analytic
, or
\(\mathbf{\Pi}^1_1\), sets are the complements of analytic sets.
Starting from the analytic (or the co-analytic) sets and applying the
operations of projection (from the product space \(\mathbb{R}\times
\mathcal{N}\) to \(\mathbb{R}\)) and complementation, one obtains the
projective sets
. The projective sets form a hierarchy of
increasing complexity. For example, if \(A\subseteq \mathbb{R}\times
\mathcal{N}\) is co-analytic, then the projection \(\{ x\in
\mathbb{R}: \exists y\in \mathcal{N}((x,y)\in A)\}\) is a projective
set in the next level of complexity above the co-analytic sets. Those
sets are called \(\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2\), and their complements are
called \(\mathbf{\Pi}^1_2\).
The projective sets come up very naturally in mathematical practice,
for it turns out that a set \(A\) of reals is projective if and only
if it is definable in the structure
\[\mathcal{R}=(\mathbb{R}, +,\cdot ,\mathbb{Z}).\]
That is, there is a first-order formula \(\varphi ( x, y_1,\ldots,
y_n)\) in the language for the structure such that for some
\(r_1,\ldots ,r_n\in \mathbb{R}\),
\[A=\{ x\in \mathbb{R}: \mathcal{R}\models \varphi(x,r_1,\ldots
,r_n)\}.\]
ZFC proves that every analytic set, and therefore every co-analytic
set, is Lebesgue measurable and has the Baire property. It also proves
that every analytic set has the perfect set property. But the perfect
set property for co-analytic sets implies that the first uncountable
cardinal, \(\aleph_1\), is a large cardinal in the constructible
universe \(L\) (see
Section 7
),
 namely a so-called inaccessible cardinal (see
Section 10
),
 which implies that one cannot prove in ZFC that every co-analytic set
has the perfect set property.
The theory of projective sets of complexity greater than co-analytic
is completely undetermined by ZFC. For example, in \(L\) there is a
\(\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2\) set that is not Lebesgue measurable and does
not have the Baire property, whereas if Martin’s axiom holds
(see
Section 11
),
 every such set has those regularity properties. There is, however, an
axiom, called the axiom of Projective Determinacy, or PD, that is
consistent with ZFC, modulo the consistency of some large cardinals
(in fact, it follows from the existence of some large cardinals), and
implies that all projective sets are regular. Moreover, PD settles
essentially all questions about the projective sets. See the entry on
large cardinals and determinacy
for further details.
6.2 Determinacy
A regularity property of sets that subsumes all other classical
regularity properties is that of being
determined
. For
simplicity, we shall work with the Baire space \(\mathcal{N}\). Recall
that the elements of \(\mathcal{N}\) are functions \(f:\mathbb{N} \to
\mathbb{N}\), that is, sequences of natural numbers of length
\(\omega\). The space \(\mathcal{N}\) is topologically equivalent
(i.e., homeomorphic) to the set of irrational points of
\(\mathbb{R}\). So, since we are interested in the regularity
properties of subsets of \(\mathbb{R}\), and since countable sets,
such as the set of rationals, are negligible in terms of those
properties, we may as well work with \(\mathcal{N}\), instead of
\(\mathbb{R}\).
Given \(A\subseteq \mathcal{N}\), the
game
associated to
\(A\), denoted by \({\mathcal G}_A\), has two players, I and II, who
play alternatively \(n_i\in \mathbb{N}\): I plays \(n_0\), then II
plays \(n_1\), then I plays \(n_2\), and so on. So, at stage \(2k\),
player I plays \(n_{2k}\) and at stage \(2k+1\), player II plays
\(n_{2k+1} \). We may visualize a run of the game as follows:
\(\mathbf{I}\)
\(n_0\)
\(n_2\)
\(n_4\)
\(\cdots\)
\(n_{2k}\)
\(\cdots\)
\(\mathbf{II}\)
\(n_1\)
\(n_3\)
\(\cdots\)
\(\cdots\)
\(n_{2k+1}\)
\(\cdots\)
After infinitely many moves, the two players produce an infinite
sequence \(n_0, n_1,n_2,\ldots\) of natural numbers. Player I wins the
game if the sequence belongs to \(A\). Otherwise, player II wins.
The game \({\mathcal{G}}_A\) is
determined
if there is a
winning strategy for one of the players. A
winning strategy
for one of the players, say for player II, is a function \(\sigma\)
from the set of finite sequences of natural numbers into
\(\mathbb{N}\), such that if the player plays according to this
function, i.e., she plays \(\sigma (n_0,\ldots ,n_{2k})\) at the
\(k\)-th turn, she will always win the game, no matter what the other
player does.
We say that a subset \(A\) of \(\mathcal{N}\) is
determined
if and only if the game \({\mathcal{G}}_A\) is determined.
One can prove in ZFC—and the use of the AC is
necessary—that there are non-determined sets. Thus, the
Axiom of Determinacy
(AD), which asserts that all subsets of
\(\mathcal{N}\) are determined, is incompatible with the AC. But
Donald Martin proved, in ZFC, that every Borel set is determined.
Further, he showed that if there exists a large cardinal called
measurable (see
Section 10
),
 then even the analytic sets are determined. The axiom of
Projective Determinacy
(PD) asserts that every projective set
is determined. It turns out that PD implies that all projective sets
of reals are regular, and Woodin has shown that, in a certain sense,
PD settles essentially all questions about the projective sets.
Moreover, PD seems to be necessary for this. Another axiom,
\(AD^{L(\Bbb R )}\), asserts that the AD holds in \(L(\Bbb R)\), which
is the least transitive class that contains all the ordinals and all
the real numbers, and satisfies the ZF axioms (see
Section 7
).
 So, \(AD^{L(\Bbb R )}\) implies that every set of reals that belongs
to \(L(\Bbb R)\) is regular. Also, since \(L(\Bbb R)\) contains all
projective sets, \(AD^{L(\Bbb R )}\) implies PD.
6.3 The Continuum Hypothesis
The Continuum Hypothesis (CH), formulated by Cantor in 1878, asserts
that every infinite set of real numbers has cardinality either
\(\aleph_0\) or the same cardinality as \(\mathbb{R}\). Thus, the CH
is equivalent to \(2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_1\).
Cantor proved in 1883 that closed sets of real numbers have the
perfect set property, from which it follows that every uncountable
closed set of real numbers has the same cardinality as \(\mathbb{R}\).
Thus, the CH holds for closed sets. More than thirty years later,
Pavel Aleksandrov extended the result to all Borel sets, and then
Mikhail Suslin to all analytic sets. Thus, all analytic sets satisfy
the CH. However, the efforts to prove that co-analytic sets satisfy
the CH would not succeed, as this is not provable in ZFC.
In 1938 Gödel proved the consistency of the CH with ZFC. Assuming
that ZF is consistent, he built a model of ZFC, known as the
constructible universe
, in which the CH holds. Thus, the
proof shows that if ZF is consistent, then so is ZF together with the
AC and the CH. Hence, assuming ZF is consistent, the AC cannot be
disproved in ZF and the CH cannot be disproved in ZFC.
See the entry on the
continuum hypothesis
for the current status of the problem.
7. Gödel’s constructible universe
Gödel’s constructible universe, denoted by \(L\), is
defined by transfinite recursion on the ordinals, similarly as \(V\),
but at successor steps, instead of taking the power set of
\(V_\alpha\) to obtain \(V_{\alpha +1}\), one only takes the set of
those subsets of \(L_\alpha\) that are definable in \(L_\alpha\),
using elements of \(L_\alpha\) as parameters. Thus, letting
\(\mathcal{P}^{Def}(X)\) to denote the set of all the subsets of \(X\)
that are definable in the structure \((X,\in )\) by a formula of the
language of set theory, using elements of \(X\) as parameters of the
definition, we let
\(L_0={\varnothing}\)
\(L_{\alpha +1}=\mathcal{P}^{Def}(L_\alpha)\)
\(L_\lambda =\bigcup \{L_\alpha :\alpha <\lambda\}\), whenever
\(\lambda\) is a limit ordinal.
Then \(L\) is the union of all the \(L_\alpha\), for \(\alpha\) an
ordinal.
Gödel showed that \(L\) satisfies all the ZFC axioms, and also
the CH. In fact, it satisfies the
Generalized Continuum
Hypothesis
(GCH), namely \(2^{\aleph_\alpha}=\aleph_{\alpha
+1}\), for every ordinal \(\alpha\).
The statement \(V=L\), called the
axiom of constructibility
,
asserts that every set belongs to \(L\). It holds in \(L\), hence it
is consistent with ZFC, and implies both the AC and the GCH.
The proper class \(L\), together with the \(\in\) relation restricted
to \(L\), is an
inner model
of ZFC, that is, a
transitive
(i.e., it contains all elements of its elements)
class that contains all ordinals and satisfies all the ZFC axioms. It
is in fact the smallest inner model of ZFC, as any other inner model
contains it.
More generally, given any set \(A\), one can build the smallest
transitive model of ZF that contains \(A\) and all the ordinals in a
similar manner as \(L\), but now starting with the transitive closure
of \(\{A \}\), i.e., the smallest transitive set that contains \(A\),
instead of \({\varnothing}\). The resulting model, \(L(A)\), need not
be however a model of the AC. One very important such model is
\(L(\mathbb{R})\), the smallest transitive model of ZF that contains
all the ordinals and all the real numbers.
The theory of constructible sets owes much to the work of Ronald
Jensen. He developed the so-called
fine structure
theory of
\(L\) and isolated some combinatorial principles, such as the diamond
(\(\diamondsuit\)) and square (\(\Box\)), which can be used to carry
out complicated constructions of uncountable mathematical objects.
Fine structure theory plays also an important role in the analysis of
bigger \(L\)-like models, such as \(L(\mathbb{R})\) or the inner
models for large cardinals (see
Section 10.1
).
8. Forcing
In 1963, twenty-five years after Gödel’s proof of the
consistency of the CH and the AC, relative to the consistency of ZF,
Paul Cohen (1966) proved the consistency of the negation of the CH,
and also of the negation of the AC, relative to the consistency of ZF.
Thus, if ZF is consistent, then the CH is undecidable in ZFC, and the
AC is undecidable in ZF. To achieve this, Cohen devised a new and
extremely powerful technique, called
forcing
, for expanding
countable transitive models of ZF, or of ZFC.
Since the axiom \(V=L\) implies the AC and the CH, any model of the
negation of the AC or the CH must violate \(V=L\). So, let’s
illustrate the idea of forcing in the case of building a model for the
negation of \(V=L\). We start with a transitive model \(M\) of ZFC,
which we may assume, without loss of generality, to be a model of
\(V=L\). To violate \(V=L\) we need to expand \(M\) by adding a new
set \(r\) so that, in the expanded model, \(r\) will be
non-constructible. Since all hereditarily-finite sets are
constructible, we aim to add an infinite set of natural numbers. The
first problem we face is that \(M\) may contain already all subsets of
\(\omega\). Fortunately, by the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem for
first-order logic, \(M\) has an elementary submodel which is
isomorphic to a countable transitive model \(N\). So, since we are
only interested in the statements that hold in \(M\), and not in \(M\)
itself, we may as well work with \(N\) instead of \(M\), and so we may
assume that \(M\) itself is countable. Then, since
\(\mathcal{P}(\omega)\) is uncountable, there are plenty of subsets of
\(\omega\) that do not belong to \(M\). But, unfortunately, we cannot
just pick any infinite subset \(r\) of \(\omega\) that does not belong
to \(M\) and add it to \(M\). The reason is that \(r\) may encode a
lot of information, so that when added to \(M\), \(M\) is no longer a
model of ZF, or it is still a model of \(V=L\). To avoid this, one
needs to pick \(r\) with great care. The idea is to pick \(r\)
generic
over \(M\), meaning that \(r\) is built from its
finite approximations in such a way that it does not have any property
that is definable in \(M\) and can be avoided. For example, by viewing
\(r\) as an infinite sequence of natural numbers in the increasing
order, the property of \(r\) containing only finitely-many even
numbers can be avoided, because given any finite approximation to
\(r\)—i.e., any finite increasing sequence of natural
numbers—one can always extend it by adding more even numbers, so
that at the end of the construction \(r\) will contain infinitely-many
even numbers; while the property of containing the number 7 cannot be
avoided, because when a finite approximation to \(r\) contains the
number 7, then it stays there no matter how the construction of \(r\)
proceeds. Since \(M\) is countable, there are such generic \(r\). Then
the expanded model \(M[r]\), which includes \(M\) and contains the new
set \(r\), is called a
generic extension
of \(M\). Since we
assumed \(M\) is a transitive model of \(V=L\), the model \(M[r]\) is
just \(L_\alpha (r)\), where \(\alpha\) is the supremum of the
ordinals of \(M\). Then one can show, using the
forcing
relation between finite approximations to \(r\) and formulas in the
language of set theory expanded with so-called
names
for sets
in the generic extension, that \(M[r]\) is a model of ZFC and \(r\) is
not constructible in \(M[r]\), hence the axiom of constructibility
\(V=L\) fails.
In general, a forcing extension of a model \(M\) is obtained by adding
to \(M\) a generic subset \(G\) of some partially ordered set
\(\mathbb{P}\) that belongs to \(M\). In the above example,
\(\mathbb{P}\) would be the set of all finite increasing sequences of
natural numbers, seen as finite approximations to the infinite
sequence \(r\), ordered by \(\subseteq\); and \(G\) would be the set
of all finite initial segments of \(r\).
In the case of the consistency proof of the negation of the CH, one
starts from a model \(M\) of ZFC, as before, and adds \(\aleph_2\) new
subsets of \(\omega\), so that in the generic extension the CH fails.
In this case one needs to use an appropriate partial ordering
\(\mathbb{P}\) so that the \(\aleph_2\) of \(M\) is not
collapsed
, i.e., it is the same as the \(\aleph_2\) of the
generic extension, and thus the generic extension \(M[G]\) will
satisfy the sentence that says that there are \(\aleph_2\) real
numbers.
8.1 Other applications of forcing
Besides the CH, many other mathematical conjectures and problems about
the continuum, and other infinite mathematical objects, have been
shown undecidable in ZFC using the forcing technique.
One important example is
Suslin’s Hypothesis
(SH).
Cantor had shown that every linearly ordered set \(S\) without
endpoints that is dense (i.e., between any two different elements of
\(S\) there is another one), complete (i.e., every subset of \(S\)
that is bounded above has a supremum), and with a countable dense
subset is isomorphic to the real line. Suslin conjectured that this is
still true if one relaxes the requirement of containing a countable
dense subset to being
ccc
, i.e., every collection of
pairwise-disjoint intervals is countable. In the early 1970s, Thomas
Jech produced a consistent counterexample using forcing, and Ronald
Jensen showed that a counterexample exists in \(L\). About the same
time, Robert Solovay and Stanley Tennenbaum (1971) developed and used
for the first time the iterated forcing technique to produce a model
where the SH holds, thus showing its independence from ZFC. In order
to make sure that the SH holds in the generic extension, one needs to
destroy all counterexamples, but by destroying one particular
counterexample one may inadvertently create new ones, and so one needs
to force again and again; in fact one needs to go on for at least
\(\omega_2\)-many steps. This is why a forcing iteration is
needed.
Among other famous mathematical problems that have been shown
undecidable in ZFC thanks to the forcing technique, especially using
iterated forcing and sometimes combined with large cardinals, we may
mention the Measure Problem and the Borel Conjecture in measure
theory, Kaplansky’s Conjecture on Banach algebras, and
Whitehead’s Problem in group theory.
9. The search for new axioms
As a result of 60 years of development of the forcing technique, and
its applications to many open problems in mathematics, there are now
literally hundreds of problems and questions, in practically all areas
of mathematics, that have been shown independent of ZFC. These include
almost all important questions about the structure of uncountable
sets. One might say that the undecidability phenomenon is pervasive,
to the point that the investigation of the uncountable has been
rendered nearly impossible in ZFC alone (see however Shelah (1994) for
remarkable exceptions).
This prompts the question about the truth-value of the statements that
are undecided by ZFC. Should one be content with them being
undecidable? Does it make sense at all to ask for their truth-value?
There are several possible reactions to this. One is the
skeptic’s position: the statements that are undecidable in ZFC
have no definite answer; and they may even be inherently vague.
Another, the common one among mathematicians, is Gödel’s
position: the undecidability only shows that the ZFC system is too
weak to answer those questions, and therefore one should search for
new axioms that once added to ZFC would answer them. The search for
new axioms has been known as
Gödel’s Program
. See
Hauser (2006) for a thorough philosophical discussion of the Program,
and also the entry on
large cardinals and determinacy
for philosophical considerations on the justification of new axioms
for set theory.
A central theme of set theory is thus the search and classification of
new axioms. These fall currently into two main types: the axioms of
large cardinals and the forcing axioms.
10. Large cardinals
One cannot prove in ZFC that there exists a regular limit cardinal
\(\kappa\), for if \(\kappa\) is such a cardinal, then \(L_\kappa\) is
a model of ZFC, and so ZFC would prove its own consistency,
contradicting Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem. Thus,
the existence of a regular limit cardinal must be postulated as a new
axiom. Such a cardinal is called
weakly inaccessible
. If, in
addition \(\kappa\) is a strong limit, i.e., \(2^\lambda <\kappa\),
for every cardinal \(\lambda <\kappa\), then \(\kappa\) is called
strongly inaccessible
. A cardinal \(\kappa\) is strongly
inaccessible if and only if it is regular and \(V_\kappa \) is a model
of ZFC. If the GCH holds, then every weakly inaccessible cardinal is
strongly inaccessible.
Large cardinals are uncountable cardinals satisfying some properties
that make them very large, and whose existence cannot be proved in
ZFC. The first weakly inaccessible cardinal is just the smallest of
all large cardinals. Beyond inaccessible cardinals there is a rich and
complex variety of large cardinals, which form a linear hierarchy in
terms of consistency strength, and in many cases also in terms of
outright implication. See the entry on
independence and large cardinals
for more details.
To formulate the next stronger large-cardinal notion, let us say that
a subset \(C\) of an infinite cardinal \(\kappa\) is
closed
if every limit of elements of \(C\) which is less than \(\kappa\) is
also in \(C\); and is
unbounded
if for every \(\alpha
<\kappa\) there exists \(\beta\in C\) greater than \(\alpha\). For
example, the set of limit ordinals less than \(\kappa\) is closed and
unbounded. Also, a subset \(S\) of \(\kappa\) is called
stationary
if it intersects every closed unbounded subset of
\(\kappa\). If \(\kappa\) is regular and uncountable, then the set of
all ordinals less than \(\kappa\) of cofinality \(\omega\) is an
example of a stationary set. A regular cardinal \(\kappa\) is called
Mahlo
if the set of strongly inaccessible cardinals smaller
than \(\kappa\) is stationary. Thus, the first Mahlo cardinal is much
larger than the first strongly inaccessible cardinal, as there are
\(\kappa\)-many strongly inaccessible cardinals smaller than
\(\kappa\).
Much stronger large cardinal notions arise from considering strong
reflection properties. Recall that the Reflection Principle
 (
Section 4
),
 which is provable in ZFC, asserts that every
true
sentence
(i.e., every sentence that holds in \(V\)) is true in some
\(V_\alpha\). A strengthening of this principle to second-order
sentences yields some large cardinals. For example, \(\kappa\) is
strongly inaccessible if and only if every \(\Sigma^1_1\) sentence
(i.e., existential second-order sentence in the language of set
theory, with one additional predicate symbol) true in any structure of
the form \((V_\kappa ,\in, A)\), where \(A\subseteq V_\kappa\), is
true in some \((V_\alpha ,\in ,A\cap V_\alpha)\), with \(\alpha
<\kappa\). The same type of reflection, but now for \(\Pi^1_1\)
sentences (i.e., universal second-order sentences), yields a much
stronger large cardinal property of \(\kappa\), called
weak
compactness
. Every weakly compact cardinal \(\kappa\) is Mahlo,
and the set of Mahlo cardinals smaller than \(\kappa\) is stationary.
By allowing reflection for more complex second-order, or even
higher-order, sentences one obtains large cardinal notions stronger
than weak compactness.
The most famous large cardinals, called
measurable
, were
discovered by Stanisław Ulam in 1930 as a result of his solution
to the Measure Problem. A (two-valued)
measure
, or
ultrafilter
, on a cardinal \(\kappa\) is a subset \(U\) of
\(\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\) that has the following properties: (i) the
intersection of any two elements of \(U\) is in \(U\); (ii) if \(X\in
U\) and \(Y\) is a subset of \(\kappa\) such that \(X\subseteq Y\),
then \(Y\in U\); and (iii) for every \(X\subseteq\kappa\), either
\(X\in U\) or \(\kappa -X\in U\), but not both. A measure \(U\) is
called
\(\kappa\)-complete
if every intersection of less than
\(\kappa\) elements of \(U\) is also in \(U\). And a measure is called
non-principal
if there is no \(\alpha <\kappa\) that
belongs to all elements of \(U\). A cardinal \(\kappa\) is called
measurable
if there exists a measure on \(\kappa\) that is
\(\kappa\)-complete and non-principal.
Measurable cardinals can be characterized by elementary embeddings of
the universe \(V\) into some transitive class \(M\). That such an
embedding \(j:V\to M\) is
elementary
means that \(j\)
preserves truth, i.e., for every formula \(\varphi (x_1,\ldots ,x_n)\)
of the language of set theory, and every \(a_1,\ldots ,a_n\), the
sentence \(\varphi (a_1,\ldots ,a_n)\) holds in \(V\) if and only if
\(\varphi (j(a_1),\ldots ,j(a_n))\) holds in \(M\). It turns out that
a cardinal \(\kappa\) is measurable if and only if there exists an
elementary embedding \(j:V\to M\), with \(M\) transitive, so that
\(\kappa\) is the first ordinal moved by \(j\), i.e., the first
ordinal such that \(j(\kappa)\ne \kappa\). We say that \(\kappa\) is
the
critical point
of \(j\), and write \(crit(j)=\kappa\).
The embedding \(j\) is definable from a \(\kappa\)-complete
non-principal measure on \(\kappa\), using the so-called
ultrapower
construction. Conversely, if \(j:V\to M\) is an
elementary embedding, with \(M\) transitive and \(\kappa=crit(j)\),
then the set \(U=\{ X\subseteq \kappa:\kappa\in j(X)\}\) is a
\(\kappa\)-complete non-principal ultrafilter on \(\kappa\). A measure
\(U\) obtained in this way from \(j\) is called
normal
.
Every measurable cardinal \(\kappa\) is weakly compact, and there are
many weakly compact cardinals smaller than \(\kappa\). In fact, below
\(\kappa\) there are many cardinals that are
totally
indescribable
, i.e., they reflect all sentences, of any
complexity, and in any higher-order language.
If \(\kappa\) is measurable and \(j:V\to M\) is given by the
ultrapower construction, then \(V_\kappa \subseteq M\), and every
sequence of length less than or equal to \(\kappa\) of elements of
\(M\) belongs to \(M\). Thus, \(M\) is quite similar to \(V\), but it
cannot be \(V\) itself. Indeed, a famous theorem of Kenneth Kunen
shows that there cannot be any elementary embedding \(j:V\to V\),
other than the trivial one, i.e., the identity. All known proofs of
this result use the Axiom of Choice, and it is an outstanding
important question if the axiom is necessary. Kunen’s Theorem
opens the door to formulating large cardinal notions stronger than
measurability by requiring that \(M\) is closer to \(V\).
For example, \(\kappa\) is called
strong
if for every ordinal
\(\alpha\) there exists an elementary embedding \(j:V\to M\), for some
\(M\) transitive, such that \(\kappa =crit(j)\) and \(V_\alpha
\subseteq M\).
Another important, and much stronger large cardinal notion is
supercompactness. A cardinal \(\kappa\) is
supercompact
if
for every \(\alpha\) there exists an elementary embedding \(j:V\to
M\), with \(M\) transitive and critical point \(\kappa\), so that
\(j(\kappa)>\alpha\) and every sequence of elements of \(M\) of
length \(\alpha\) belongs to \(M\).
Woodin cardinals fall between strong and supercompact. Every
supercompact cardinal is Woodin, and if \(\delta\) is Woodin, then
\(V_\delta\) is a model of ZFC in which there is a proper class of
strong cardinals. Thus, while a Woodin cardinal \(\delta\) need not be
itself very strong—the first one is not even weakly
compact—it implies the existence of many large cardinals in
\(V_\delta\).
Beyond supercompact cardinals we find the
extendible
cardinals, the
huge
, the
super huge
, etc.
Kunen’s theorem about the non-existence of a non-trivial
elementary embedding \(j:V\to V\) actually shows that there cannot be
an elementary embedding \(j:V_{\lambda +2}\to V_{\lambda +2}\)
different from the identity, for any \(\lambda\).
The strongest large cardinal notions not known to be inconsistent,
modulo ZFC, are the following:
There exists an elementary embedding \(j:V_{\lambda +1}\to V_{\lambda
+1}\) different from the identity.
There exists an elementary embedding \(j:L(V_{\lambda +1})\to
L(V_{\lambda +1})\) different from the identity.
Large cardinals form a linear hierarchy of increasing consistency
strength. In fact they are the stepping stones of the interpretability
hierarchy of mathematical theories. See the entry on
independence and large cardinals
for more details. Typically, given any sentence \(\varphi\) of the
language of set theory, exactly one the following three possibilities
holds about the theory ZFC plus \(\varphi\):
ZFC plus \(\varphi\) is inconsistent.
ZFC plus \(\varphi\) is equiconsistent with ZFC (i.e., ZFC is
consistent if and only if so is ZFC plus \(\varphi\)).
ZFC plus \(\varphi\) is equiconsistent with ZFC plus the existence of
some large cardinal.
Thus, large cardinals can be used to prove that a given sentence
\(\varphi\) does not imply another sentence \(\psi\), modulo ZFC, by
showing that ZFC plus \(\psi\) implies the consistency of some large
cardinal, whereas ZFC plus \(\varphi\) is consistent assuming the
existence of a smaller large cardinal, or just assuming the
consistency of ZFC. In other words, \(\psi\) has higher consistency
strength than \(\varphi\), modulo ZFC. Then, by Gödel’s
second incompleteness theorem, ZFC plus \(\varphi\) cannot prove
\(\psi\), assuming ZFC plus \(\varphi\) is consistent.
As we already pointed out, one cannot prove in ZFC that large
cardinals exist. But everything indicates that their existence not
only cannot be disproved, but in fact the assumption of their
existence is a very reasonable axiom of set theory. For one thing,
there is a lot of evidence for their consistency, especially for those
large cardinals for which it is possible to construct a canonical
inner model.
10.1 Inner models of large cardinals
An
inner model
of ZFC is a transitive proper class that
contains all the ordinals and satisfies all ZFC axioms. Thus, \(L\) is
the smallest inner model, while \(V\) is the largest. Some large
cardinals, such as inaccessible, Mahlo, or weakly-compact, may exist
in \(L\). That is, if \(\kappa\) has one of these large cardinal
properties, then it also has the property in \(L\). But some large
cardinals cannot exist in \(L\). Indeed, Scott (1961) showed that if
there exists a measurable cardinal \(\kappa\), then \(V\ne L\). It is
important to notice that \(\kappa\) does belong to \(L\), since \(L\)
contains all ordinals, but it is not measurable in \(L\) because a
\(\kappa\)-complete non-principal measure on \(\kappa\) cannot exist
there.
If \(\kappa\) is a measurable cardinal, then one can construct an
\(L\)-like model in which \(\kappa\) is measurable by taking a
\(\kappa\)-complete non-principal and normal measure \(U\) on
\(\kappa\), and proceeding as in the definition of \(L\), but now
using \(U\) as an additional predicate. The resulting model, called
\(L[U]\), is an inner model of ZFC in which \(\kappa\) is measurable,
and in fact \(\kappa\) is the only measurable cardinal. The model is
canonical, in the sense that any other normal measure witnessing the
measurability of \(\kappa\) would yield the same model, and has many
of the properties of \(L\). For instance, it has a projective well
ordering of the reals, and it satisfies the GCH.
Building similar \(L\)-like models for stronger large cardinals, such
as strong, or Woodin, is much harder. Those models are of the form
\(L[E]\), where \(E\) is a sequence of
extenders
, each
extender being a coherent system of measures, that encode the relevant
elementary embeddings.
The largest \(L\)-like inner models for large cardinals that have been
obtained so far can contain Woodin cardinals that are limits of Woodin
cardinals (Neeman 2002). However, building an \(L\)-like model for a
supercompact cardinal is still a challenge. The supercompact barrier
seems to be the crucial one, for Woodin has shown that for a natural
kind of inner model for a supercompact cardinal \(\kappa\), which he
calls a
weak extender model for the supercompactness of \( \kappa
\)
, all stronger large cardinals greater than \(\kappa\) that may
exist in \(V\), such as extendible, huge, etc. would also exist in the
model.
10.2 Consequences of large cardinals
The existence of large cardinals has dramatic consequences, even for
simply-definable small sets, like the projective sets of real numbers.
For example, Solovay (1970) proved, assuming that there exists a
measurable cardinal, that all \(\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2\) sets of reals
are Lebesgue measurable and have the Baire property, which cannot be
proved in ZFC alone. And Shelah and Woodin (1990) showed that the
existence of a proper class of Woodin cardinals implies that the
theory of \(L(\mathbb{R})\), even with real numbers as parameters,
cannot be changed by forcing, which implies that all sets of real
numbers that belong to \(L(\mathbb{R})\) are regular. Further, under a
weaker large-cardinal hypothesis, namely the existence of infinitely
many Woodin cardinals, Martin and Steel (1989) proved that every
projective set of real numbers is determined, i.e., the axiom of PD
holds, hence all projective sets are regular. Moreover, Woodin showed
that the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals, plus a
measurable cardinal above all of them, implies that every set of reals
in \(L(\mathbb{R})\) is determined, i.e., the axiom
\(AD^{L(\mathbb{R})}\) holds, hence all sets of real numbers that
belong to \(L(\mathbb{R})\), and therefore all projective sets, are
regular. He also showed that Woodin cardinals provide the optimal
large cardinal assumptions by proving that the following two
statements:
There are infinitely many Woodin cardinals.
\(AD^{L({\Bbb R})}\).
are equiconsistent, i.e., ZFC plus 1 is consistent if and only if ZFC
plus 2 is consistent. See the entry on
large cardinals and determinacy
for more details and related results.
Another area in which large cardinals play an important role is the
exponentiation of singular cardinals. The so-called
Singular
Cardinal Hypothesis
(SCH) completely determines the behavior of
the exponentiation for singular cardinals, modulo the exponentiation
for regular cardinals. The SCH follows from the GCH, and so it holds
in \(L\). A consequence of the SCH is that if
\(2^{\aleph_n}<\aleph_\omega\), for all finite \(n\), then
\(2^{\aleph_{\omega}}=\aleph_{\omega +1}\). Thus, if the GCH holds for
cardinals smaller than \(\aleph_\omega\), then it also holds at
\(\aleph_\omega\). The SCH holds above the first supercompact cardinal
(Solovay). But Magidor (1977) showed that, remarkably, assuming the
existence of large cardinals it is possible to build a model of ZFC
where the GCH first fails at \(\aleph_\omega\), hence the SCH fails.
Large cardinals stronger than measurable are actually needed for this.
In contrast, however, ZFC alone suffices to prove that if the SCH
holds for all cardinals smaller than \(\aleph_{\omega_1}\), then it
also holds for \(\aleph_{\omega_1}\). Moreover, if the SCH holds for
all singular cardinals of countable cofinality, then it holds for all
singular cardinals (Silver).
11. Forcing axioms
Forcing axioms are axioms of set theory that assert that certain
existential statements are absolute between the universe \(V\) of all
sets and its (ideal) forcing extensions, i.e., some existential
statements that hold in some forcing extensions of \(V\) are already
true in \(V\). The first forcing axiom was formulated by Donald Martin
in the wake of the Solovay-Tennenbaum proof of the consistency of
Suslin’s Hypothesis, and is now known as
Martin’s
Axiom
(MA). Before we state it, let us say that a
partial
ordering
is a non-empty set \(P\) together with a binary relation
\(\leq\) on \(P\) that is reflexive and transitive. Two elements,
\(p\) and \(q\), of \(P\) are called
compatible
if there
exists \(r\in P\) such that \(r\leq p\) and \(r\leq q\). An
antichain
of \(P\) is a subset of \(P\) whose elements are
pairwise-incompatible. A partial ordering \(P\) is called
ccc
if every antichain of \(P\) is countable. A non-empty subset \(G\) of
\(P\) is called a
filter
if (i) every two elements of \(G\)
are compatible, and (ii) if \(p\in G\) and \(p\leq q\), then also
\(q\in G\). Finally, a subset \(D\) of \(P\) is called
dense
if for every \(p\in P\) there is \(q\in D\) such that \(q\leq p\).
MA asserts the following:
For every ccc partial ordering \(P\) and every set \(\{ D_\alpha
:\alpha <\kappa \}\), where \(\kappa \lt 2^{\aleph_0}\), of dense
subsets of \(P\), there exists a filter \(G\subseteq P\) that is
generic
for the set, i.e., \(G\cap D_\alpha \ne
{\varnothing}\), for all \(\alpha <\kappa\).
Since MA follows easily from the CH, MA is only of interest if the CH
fails. Martin and Solovay (1970) proved that MA plus the negation of
the CH is consistent with ZFC, using iterated forcing with the ccc
property. At first sight, MA may not look like an axiom, namely an
obvious, or at least reasonable, assertion about sets, but rather like
a technical statement about ccc partial orderings. It does look more
natural, however, when expressed in topological terms, for it is
simply a generalization of the well-known Baire Category Theorem,
which asserts that in every compact Hausdorff topological space the
intersection of countably-many dense open sets is non-empty. Indeed,
MA is equivalent to:
In every compact Hausdorff ccc topological space, the intersection of
less than \(2^{\aleph_0}\)-many dense open sets is non-empty.
MA has many different equivalent formulations and has been used very
successfully to settle a large number of open problems in other areas
of mathematics. For example, MA plus the negation of the CH implies
Suslin’s Hypothesis and that every \(\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2\) set
of reals is Lebesgue measurable and has the Baire property. It also
implies that \(2^{\aleph_0}\) is a regular cardinal, but it does not
decide what cardinal it is. See Fremlin (1984) for many more
consequences of MA and other equivalent formulations. In spite of
this, the status of MA as an axiom of set theory is still unclear.
Perhaps the most natural formulation of MA, from a foundational point
of view, is in terms of
generic absoluteness
. Namely, MA is
equivalent to the following:
For every ccc partial ordering \(P\), if an existential statement,
containing subsets of some cardinal less than \(2^{\aleph_0}\) as
parameters, holds in an (ideal) generic extension of \(V\) obtained by
forcing with \(P\), then the statement is true, i.e., it holds in
\(V\). In other words, if a set having a property that depends only on
bounded subsets of \( 2^{\aleph_0}\) exists in some (ideal) generic
extension of \(V\) obtained by forcing with a ccc partial ordering,
then a set with that property already exists in \(V\).
The notion of ideal generic extension of \(V\) can be made precise in
terms of so-called Boolean-valued models, which provide an alternative
version of forcing.
Much stronger forcing axioms than MA (for \(\omega_1\)) were
introduced in the 1980s, such as J. Baumgartner’s
Proper
Forcing Axiom
(PFA), and the stronger
Martin’s
Maximum
(MM) of Foreman, Magidor, and Shelah (1988). Both the PFA
and MM are consistent relative to the existence of a supercompact
cardinal. The PFA asserts the same as MA, but for partial orderings
that have a property weaker than the ccc, called
properness
,
introduced by Shelah. And MM asserts the same for the wider class of
partial orderings that, when forcing with them, do not destroy
stationary subsets of \(\omega_1\).
Strong forcing axioms, such as the PFA and MM imply that all
projective sets of reals are determined (PD), and have many other
strong consequences in infinite combinatorics. Notably, they imply
that the cardinality of the continuum is \(\aleph_2\).
A different forcing axiom is Woodin’s Axiom \((\ast)\), which
resulted from his analysis of \(\mathbb{P}_{{\rm max}}\) forcing
extensions over models of AD. Even though a stronger form of MM known
as \({\rm MM}^{++}\) and Axiom \((\ast)\) have similar and very rich
consequences, both their motivation and their formulation are very
different, to the point that they were seen as competing axioms. Their
connection was far from being clear, until Asperó and Schindler
(2021) showed that, in the presence of large cardinals, Axiom
\((\ast)\) is equivalent to a bounded form of \({\rm MM}^{++}\), and
therefore to a natural generic absoluteness principle.

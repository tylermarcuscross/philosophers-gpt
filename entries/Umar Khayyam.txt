Umar Khayyam

Of knowledge naught remained I did not know,
Of secrets, scarcely any, high or low;
All day and night for three score and twelve years,
I pondered, just to learn that naught I know.

Rubā‘iyyāt
,
Sa‘idī 1991, 125)
Umar Khayyam was a polymath, scientist, philosopher, and poet of the
11
th
century CE. Whereas his mathematical works and poetry
have been the subject of much discussion, his recently edited and
published philosophical works have remained a largely neglected area
of study. In what follows, we shall review and comment on the salient
features of Khayyam’s poetry and philosophy, their relationship
with one another, and Khayyam’s pioneering views on
mathematics.
Traditionally, Umar Khayyam’s significance in the annals of
Islamic intellectual tradition is due to his
Rubā‘iyyāt
(quatrains) and his scientific
works, especially those in the field of mathematics. The latter have
always been overshadowed by his poetry. In recent years, critical
editions of the philosophical works of Khayyam have been published
which not only provide us with an insight into his philosophical
thought but also provide a context for a more philosophical
interpretation of the
Rubā‘iyyāt
.
In his
Rubā‘iyyāt
, Khayyam challenged
religious doctrines, alluded to the hypocrisy of the clergy, cast
doubt on almost every facet of religious belief, and appears to have
advocated a type of humanism. It is no wonder that some referred to
him as the “Eastern Voltaire” (Dole 1901, 81). This
Western image, solidified by the Victorian sense of the exotic,
romantic, and often erotic notions attached to the East, was echoed
through the rendition of the
Rubā‘iyyāt
by
Edward FitzGerald in the 19
th
century.

1. The Formative Period
Abu’l Fatḥ ʿUmar ibn Ibrāhīm Khayyām,
commonly known as Umar Khayyām, is the best known Iranian
poet-scientist in the West. He was born in the district of
Shādyakh of Nayshābūr (originally
“Nayshāpūr”) in the province of
Khorāsān sometime around 439 AH/1048
 CE,
[

]
and died there between 515 and 520 AH/1124 and 1129
 CE.
[

]
The word “Khayyām,” means “tent maker,”
and thus, it is likely that his father Ibrāhīm or
forefathers were tent makers. Khayyām is said to have been quiet,
reserved, and humble. His reluctance to accept students drew criticism
from opponents, who claimed that he was impatient, bad tempered, and
uninterested in sharing his knowledge. Given the radical nature of his
views in the
Rubā‘iyyāt
, he may merely have
wished to remain intellectually inconspicuous.
The secrets which my book of love has bred,
Cannot be told for fear of loss of head;
Since none is fit to learn, or cares to know,
‘Tis better all my thoughts remain unsaid.
(
Rubā‘iyyāt
, Tirtha 1941,
266)
Khayyam’s reference to Ibn Sīnā as “his
teacher” has led some to speculate that he actually studied with
Ibn Sīnā. Although this is incorrect, several traditional
biographers indicate that Umar Khayyam may have studied with
Bahmanyār, an outstanding student of Ibn
 Sīnā.
[

]
Following a number of journeys to Herat, Ray, and Iṣfahān
(the latter being the capital of the Seljuqs) in search of libraries
and in pursuit of astronomical calculations, Khayyam’s declining
health caused him to return to Nayshābūr, where he died in
the district of Shādyākh.
2. The Philosophical Works and Thoughts of Umar Khayyam
Khayyam wrote little, but his works—some fourteen treatises
identified to date—were remarkable. They can be categorized
primarily in three genres: mathematics, philosophy, and poetry. His
philosophical works which have been edited and published recently are
(we have not translated
risālah

) in

Except the first work mentioned above which is a free translation and
commentary on a discourse by Ibn Sīnā, the other six
philosophical treatises represent Khayyam’s own independent
philosophical views. It is noteworthy that Khayyam’s
philosophical treatises were written in the Peripatetic tradition at a
time when philosophy in general and rationalism in particular were
under attack by orthodox Muslim jurists—so much that Khayyam had
to defend himself against the charge of “being a
philosopher.”
“A philosopher I am,” my enemies falsely say,
But God knows I am not what they say;
While in this sorrow-laden nook, I reside
Need to know who I am, and why Here stay
(translation by Aminrazavi)
Khayyam identifies the main types of inquiry in
“philosophy” along the Peripatetic line: “The
essential and real inquiries that are discussed in philosophy are
three inquiries, [first], ‘is it?’…second,
‘what is it?’…third, ‘why is
it?’” (
On Being and Obligation
, Malik (ed.) 1998,
335). While these are standard Aristotelian questions, for Khayyam
they have a wider range of philosophical implications, especially with
regard to the following topics:
The existence of God, His attributes and knowledge
Hierarchy of Existents and the problem of multiplicity
Eschatology
Theodicy
Predeterminism and free will
Subjects and predicates
Existence and essence
2.1 The existence of God, His attributes and knowledge
In accordance with the Avicennan tradition, Khayyam refers to God as
the “Necessary Existence” (or as it is more common in
English translation, “Necessary Existent”) and “that
which cannot be conceived unless being existent,” and “the
one whose existence is from its essence, from the intellect’s
[point of view]” (
On Existence
, Jamshīd Nijād
Awwal (ed.), 112) and then offers cosmological, teleological, and
ontological arguments for His
 existence.
[
4
]
The most fundamental principle about the necessary existent is its
absolute oneness. Khayyam discusses issues such as unity, necessity,
causality, and the impossibility of a chain of causes and effects
continuing
ad infinitum
. In his translation of
Avicenna’s treatise, as Malik (ed.) (1998, 307) has rightly
pointed out, Khayyam adds short remarks and explications to clarify
and support Avicenna’s view after each sub-section. He
completely follows Avicenna’s view on God’s existence and
His attributes. God, the necessary existent, is neither a substance
nor an accident (
Principles of Existence
, Malik (ed.) 1998,
388). There is no motion in Him, and thus He is not in time. He has no
intention (
qaṣd
), end or goal (
gharaḍ
),
since having an end or a goal indicates
not having something
[
desirable
], and this in turn implies
imperfection
(
Lucid Discourse
, Malik (ed.) 1998, 313–6). Among other
topics pertaining to God which Khayyam discusses are God’s
knowledge of universals and particulars, the absolutely simple essence
of the Necessary Existent, and that “all His attributes, with
regard to Its essence, are [rational] considerations
(
iʿitbarāt
)” (ibid). We will return to this
last point, on rational considerations, below.
2.2 Hierarchy of existents and the Problem of Unity and Multiplicity
For Khayyam, one of the most complex philosophical problems is to
account for the hierarchy of existents and the manner in which they
are ranked in terms of their nobility. In
On Being and
Obligation
, Khayyam asserts:
What remains from among the most important and difficult problems [to
solve] is the difference among the existents in their degree of
nobility…. Perhaps I, and my teacher, the master of all who
have proceeded before him, Avicenna, have thoughtfully reflected upon
this problem, and consequently have reached the point of convincing
our selves [of its truth]. This conviction is either because of the
weakness of our souls, which are convinced by something inwardly
faulty and apparently fancy, or because of the strength in that view,
which makes us convince ourselves [of its truth], and we will shortly
express part of that view symbolically. (
On Being and
Obligation
, Malik (ed.) 1998, 338)
How to read the last sentence of the above quote may be subject to
scholarly debate. Particularly, Khayyam’s formulation may
suggest that he is not fully satisfied with the Neoplatonic view he is
going to present. Nonetheless, in his treatise “On the Knowledge
of the Universal Principles of Existence” (
Principles of
Existence
, Malik (ed.) 1998, 381–3), as well as some other
works, Khayyam adopts the Neoplatonic scheme of emanation and offers
an analysis of a number of traditional philosophical themes within
this context. Particularly, he follows the theory of hierarchical
intellects and souls associated with the celestial spheres, as
interpreted in the Islamic philosophical “emanationist”
tradition, to explain creation and celestial motions (ibid, 382).
2.3 Eschatology
Khayyam has been accused of believing in the transmigration of the
soul and even corporeal resurrection in this world. This is partially
due to some of the inauthentic quatrains attributed to
him. Khayyam’s philosophical treatises indicate that he did
believe in life after death, and in this regard his views were in line
with traditional Islamic eschatological doctrine. Khayyam the poet,
however, plays with the notion of life after death in a variety of
ways. First, he casts doubt on the very existence of a life beyond our
earthly existence; second, he says that based on our very experience
in this world, all things seem to perish and not return. Some of his
poems play with the idea of the transmigration of the soul
(
tanāsukh
). This can be taken symbolically, rather than
literally; in numerous poems he tells us that we turn to dust and it
is from our dust that other living beings rise. Khayyam’s
comments regarding the possibility of life after death may well have
been an indirect criticism of the orthodox jurists who spoke of the
intricacies of heaven and hell with
 certainty.
[
5
]
Khayyam’s ideas about the human soul and its persistence are
scarce and scattered in his philosophical writings. Toward the end of
The Necessity of Contrariety
(Nājī
Iṣfahānī (ed.) 2000, 169–70), he explains the
notion of
persistence
as
existence through time
, and
rejects the view that the concept of
existence
itself implies
duration
(in time). It seems to follow that if an entity
exists atemporally, its ontological status cannot be described as
“persisting.” In his translation of Avicenna’s
treatise, Khayyam is explicit that “when it [the rational soul]
is separated from the matter, it becomes like the angels, in
simplicity and apprehension of the intelligible [meanings], till
immortal persistence inevitably accompanies it” (
Lucid
Discourse
, Malik (ed.) 1998, 317). Describing the fate of the
rational soul as “immortally persisting” suggests that for
Khayyam, like Avicenna, the rational soul is an incorporeal entity
with temporal existence.
2.4 Theodicy (The Problem of Evil)
The problem of theodicy, which Khayyam handles both philosophically
and poetically, is one of the most prevalent themes in his quatrains,
yet his approach differs in each medium. It is an irony that while in
his philosophy Khayyam offers a rational explanation for the existence
of evil, in his
Rubā‘iyyāt
he strongly
criticizes the presence of evil and finds no justification for it
fully satisfying. One may argue that such an inconsistency bears
witness to the fact that the philosophical treatises and the
Rubā‘iyyāt
are not authored by the same
person. While this remains a possibility, it is also reasonable that
these seemingly contradictory works might belong to the same person.
The discrepancy speaks to the human condition that despite our
rationalization of the problem of evil, on a practical and emotional
level, we remain fundamentally bewildered by the unnecessary presence
of so much pain and suffering.
Qāḍī Abū Naṣr, a statesman and scholar from
Shirāz, posed the following question to Khayyam:
It is therefore implied that the Necessary Existent is the cause of
the occurrence of evil, contrariety and corruption in the world. This
is not worthy of the Divine status. So how can we resolve this problem
and the conflict, so evil will not be attributed to the Necessary
Existent? (
The Necessity of Contrariety
, Malik (ed.), 1998,
362–3)
The first sentence of the above quote is in fact the conclusion of a
short argument, described on the previous page. Here is a slightly
revised formulation of that argument:
Evil and contrary events occur in this world.
The evil and contrary events that occur in this world are either
necessary existents or contingent existents.
They cannot be necessary existents (because, this implies that
multiple things are necessary existents, but it has been demonstrated
that there is one and only one Necessary Existent, which is absolutely
simple and one in all respects).
So,
The evil and contrary events that occur in this world are
contingent existents.
But
The Necessary Existent is the ultimate cause of all contingent
existents.
Thus,
The Necessary Existent is the ultimate cause of the occurrence of
evil and contrary events.
If A is the cause of B and B is the cause of C, then A is the
cause of C (Khayyam has formulated this premise explicitly in his
response to the question).
Therefore,
The Necessary Existent is (not only the ultimate cause but) the
cause of the occurrence of evil and contrary events.
In
The Necessity of Contrariety
, Khayyam offers an extended
argument to exonerate God from being morally blameworthy for the
creation of evil (the expression “morally blameworthy” is
ours). Some have understood his response in terms of associating evil
with non-existence or absence. Accordingly, God has created the
essences of all contingent beings, which are good in and of themselves
since any being, ontologically speaking, is better than non-being.
Evil therefore represents an absence, a non-being for which God cannot
be blamed (Nasr,
The Poet Scientist Khayyam as Philosophe
r
;
 Aminrazavi 2007,
 172–5).
[
6
]
A closer reading of the text, however, may suggest a different and
novel solution. Evil is sometimes introduced as nonexistence (
On
Existence
, Jamshīd Nijād Awwal (ed.) 2000, 118) and
sometimes as following from nonexistence (
ibid
. and
The
Necessity of Contrariety,
Nājī Iṣfahānī
2000, 168), which itself follows from the contrary relations that hold
between contingent objects or events. Many instances of evil,
according to Khayyam, do exist in reality. Khayyam’s main point
is not that evil acts and events are absences or negative facts, as it
were. Though he talks about nonexistence and associates evil with
absence, the contribution of his argument is not to conceptualize all
instances of evil in terms of nonexistence or merely mental existence.
Rather, evil is characterized as the concomitant of the contrary
relations that obtain between contingent existents, which themselves
are essentially created by God. In this formulation, two notions call
for clarification. First, the notion of “concomitant”
(
lawāzim
) as a “necessary non-essential
predicable”: this notion is well known in the Avicennan school
and borrowed from the Aristotelian notion of
per se accidents
(
kath’ hauto sembebêkôs
). The second notion
is the distinction between
essential
and
accidental
causation. This is also rooted in an Aristotelian theory of causation
and Avicenna’s reconstruction of that. Evil, as the concomitant
of the contrary relations that hold between contingent existents, is
only accidentally created by God. Otherwise put, God essentially
causes the (“quiddative,” this is our term) contingent
beings and only accidentally causes contrary relations, and, as a
result, the evil that follows from the co-existence of those essences.
Furthermore, Khayyam claims, the problem in this case is whether God
is the
essential
cause of the occurrence of evil. This can be
interpreted as a value claim: causing something is not worthy of
Divine status only if God essentially and intentionally causes it.
(Khayyam immediately modifies this claim, explaining that the First,
properly speaking, has no “intention”
(
qaṣd
) but there is eternal guardianship
(ʿ
ināya
).) Since God does not essentially and
intentionally cause evil (in fact, the existence of some contrary
relations is a necessary consequence of creating (quiddative)
contingent existents), it follows that God accidentally causes evil
and this is not morally problematic.
In the appendix to his response to the first question, Khayyam raises
another objection: Given that evil is accidentally created by God and
assuming that God is omniscient, “Why did God essentially create
things, i.e. (quiddative) contingent existents, if He knew their
existence would imply contrary relations, nonexistence, and eventually
evil?” Khayyam’s response is based on three premises: (1)
the existence of evil can be justified if the benefits following from
essentially creating (quiddative) contingent beings massively outweigh
the harms following from accidentally creating contrary relations (and
eventually evil). Furthermore, (2) withholding an act whose benefits
massively outweigh the harms following it, given an appropriate
principle of proportionality, would imply massive evil. And (3), in
fact the benefits following from essentially creating (quiddative)
contingent beings massively outweigh the harms following from
accidentally creating contrary relations (and eventually evil). These
premises are intended to justify God’s essential creation of
contingent beings despite His knowledge of the ensuing evil.
2.5 Determinism and Free Will
Both his Western and Eastern expositors consider Khayyam to be a
predeterminist (
jabrī
). However, his views on the
subject matter are far more complex. Some (Nasr,
The Poet Scientist Khayyam as Philosopher
;
Aminrazavi 2007, 175) have interpreted “On Being and
Obligation” as a treatise on the problem of determinism and free
will. According to Aminrazavi (2007, 175), Khayyam uses the term
taklīf
(translated by Nasr (ibid) and Aminrazavi (ibid)
as “necessity” as well) to denote
“determinism.” There is a short paragraph in
The
Necessity of Contrariety
that Nasr and Aminrazavi interpret as
indicating that Khayyam is inclined to “predeterminism,”
or “determinism” as they use the term, provided it is not
taken to its extreme:
As to his question [i.e.,
Qāḍī
Nasawī’s
question] concerning which of the two groups
[pre-determinists or free will theorists] are closer to truth, I say
prima facie
and at the first sight, perhaps the
pre-determinists are closer to truth, provided they do not enter into
their nonsensical and absurd [claims], for in this case they verily
depart far from truth. (
The Necessity of Contrariety
,
Nājī Iṣfahānī (ed.) 2000, 169)
Aminrazavi (2007, 177–80), then, identifies and explains three
types of “determinism” in Khayyam’s view as
follows:
Universal-cosmic
Socio-economic
Ontological
In the universal and cosmic sense, our presence in this world and our
entry and exit is predetermined, a condition that Khayyam bemoans
throughout his
Rubā‘iyyāt
. The
universal-cosmic determinism is the cause of our bewilderment and
existential anxiety. Khayyam expresses this when he says:
With Earth’s first Clay They did the Last Man knead,
And there of the Last Harvest sow’d the Seed:
And the first Morning of Creation wrote
What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read.
(
Rubā‘iyyāt
, FitzGerald
1859, 41)
The second sense of determinism is Socio-economic, which is rarely
addressed by Muslim philosophers. Khayyam incidentally refers to this
notion, for example, in:
God created the human species such that it is not possible for it to
survive and reach perfection unless it is through reciprocity,
assistance, and help. Until food, clothes, and a home that are the
essentials of life are not prepared, the possibility of the attainment
of perfection does not exist. (
On Being and Obligation
,
Hashemipour (ed.) 2000, 143).
Finally there is “ontological determinism,” which relies
on a Neoplatonic scheme of emanation which Khayyam considers to be
“among the most significant and complex of all questions,”
since “the order of the world is in accordance to how the wisdom
of God decreed it” (
On Being and Obligation
,
Hashemipour (ed.) 2000, 145). He continues, “obligation
(
taklīf
) is a command issued from God Most
High, so people may attain those perfections that lead them to
happiness” (
ibid
, 143). This Greek concept of
happiness, restated by Fārābī as “For every being
is made to achieve the ultimate perfection it is susceptible of
achieving according to its specific place in the order of
being,” (al-Fārābī 1973, 224) implies that our
ontological status or capacity is (at least to some extent)
pre-determined.
Here, we have translated
taklīf
as
“obligation” (not “necessity”) and
jabr
as “
predeterminism
” (not
“determinism”). This may be justified as follows:
“Determinism” as we use it today is considered to be
compatible with free will (from the compatibilist point of view) but
jabr
, both in its historical context and in contemporary
usage, is not considered to be compatible with free will. Furthermore,
we are not sure how to interpret the short quote in response to the
second question in
The Necessity of Contrariety
(Nājī Iṣfahānī (ed.) 2000, 169). It can be
interpreted as a formulation of Khayyam’s dissatisfaction with
both predeterminism and the free will view. This is because he says
that predeterminism is closer to truth “
prima facie
and
at the first sight” and then suggests that if the view is
expanded, or fully applied, it can lead to nonsensical consequences.
It is noteworthy that in the same passage he does not attempt to
defend the free will view either. The original term for what has been
translated as the “free will” view here,
is
qadariyya
(
Dānish nāmah-yi
Khayyāmī
, Malik (ed.) 1998, 344, note 2). The term
is associated with different views and problems, one of which is
whether humans are the
creators
(
khāliq
) of
their sinful acts. The term “creator” is important in this
context, particularly because it is not necessarily synonymous with
“cause” and more importantly, because some, particularly
in the early Islamic Kalām tradition, held the view that the only
real creator is God. So, the context of this discussion is not just
the metaphysics of causation, as we use the term. Finally, the above
considerations make reconstructing Khayyam’s view on this matter
and mapping it on the contemporary views on “determinism”
more difficult than it might initially appear.  Khayyam has the
concept of “necessitation” (
wujūb
) and
discusses that in his treatises on existence [references 5 and 6
above] at length. Thus, the three notions of “determinism”
introduced by Aminrazavi may require further investigation.
2.6 Subjects, Predicates, and Attributes
In a complex discussion, Khayyam presents his views on the
relationship between the subject, predicate, and attributes using a
mixture of original insight and Aristotelian precedent. Dividing the
attributes (
al-awṣāf
) into two categories,
essential and accidental, he discusses both categories and their
subdivisions, such as concomitant accidental attributes vs. detachable
accidental attributes (and the latter, in turn, is divided into merely
detachable in estimation vs. detachable in estimation
and
in
existence) in details (
On Existence
, Jamshīd Nijād
Awwal (ed.), 101–2).
Developing the same line of argument in
The Necessity of
Contrariety
(Nājī Iṣfahānī (ed.) 2000,
164), Khayyam proposes the following characterization of an
“essential attribute”:
[An attribute (
waṣf
)] is essential if [1] it is not
possible to conceive
the subject
(
al-mawṣūf
) [of the attribution] except by
conceiving
that
as having the attribute in the first place,
and it is required for it [2] to belong to the subject [of the
attribution] with no [extra] cause, like
animality
[as an
essential attribute] of
human
, and [3 it is required for it]
to be prior to
the subject
[of the attribution] essentially
(
bi al-
ḏ
āt
), that
is, it [i.e. the essential attribute] is the cause of the subject [of
the attribution] and not its effect, like
animal
[as an
essential attribute] of
human
and [also]
rational
[as an essential attribute of
human
] (
The Necessity of
Contrariety
, Nājī Iṣfahānī 2000, 164;
emphasis is ours).
(We have translated
waṣf
as
attribute
and
mawṣūf
as
the subject
of attribution.)
Khayyam’s explication includes three conditions for an essential
attribute (in relation to the subject of attribution): (1) conceptual
priority, (2) no causal dependence (or posteriority), and (3) causal
priority. First, conceptual priority indicates that Khayyam
understands “essential attributes” not merely as
metaphysically essential properties; they should satisfy some
epistemological condition as well. Second, “no causal
dependence” distinguishes essential attributes from all other
attributes that do not follow from the essence of something (and thus
their attribution to the subject requires a cause distinct from the
subject). This is a strong, and well-known, metaphysical condition in
the Islamic Aristotelian tradition. Nonetheless,
“concomitants” may satisfy “no causal
dependence” requirement as well, because their attribution to
the subject does not require any extra cause. Third, causal priority
is supposed to exclude concomitants. So, no concomitant, even though
necessarily predicable of its subject, is an essential attribute in
the sense under discussion.
According to Aminrazavi’s interpretation of the above quote,
“essential attributes are those which are not possible to
conceive of without the preconception of these
a priori
(
badawī
) attributes, such as ‘animality which is
an essential attribute of man’” (Aminrazavi 2007, 183).
The term
badawī
is not in the original Arabic text, in
fact it can only be found in a Persian translation of
The
Necessity of Contrariety
(Nājī Iṣfahānī
2000, 171). Moreover,
badawī
can be translated in many
ways and “
a priori
” is not its most
straightforward translation, if a proper translation in the first
place. Finally, the above observations suggest that Khayyam’s
notion of “essential attributes” only implies conceptual
priority (not
a prioricity
) of the essential attribute(s) to its
subject. Conceiving
animal
is prior to conceiving
human;
this does not imply that the attribute
animal is a
priori
(in its Kantian sense). If one could find further pieces
of evidence in Khayyam’s philosophy, with regard to
a
priori
concepts or
innate
ideas, in its Cartesian sense,
one might attempt to bolster Aminrazavi’s claim. At present, we
are not aware of any such evidence or argument.
Khayyam also divides (essential and accidental) attributes into
considerational
(
i‘tibārī
) and
existential
(
wujūdī
)
(
i‘tibārī
has also been translated in the
literature of Islamic/Arabic philosophy as
item of
consideration
,
abstract
,
secondary
,
fictional
,
intentional
,
mental
, and
conceptual
; see, for example,
Online Dictionary of Arabic Philosophical Terms
.
 In this context, these translations may have misleading connotations.
Thus, we suggest
considerational
, and use it in contrast with
existential
). Khayyam attempts to provide different criteria
for this distinction:
And the existential [attribute] is like the attribute
black
[attributed to a]
material object
(
jism
), when [in
fact] it is black. Thus,
being black
is an existential
attribute, that is, it is an additional meaning to the essence [to
which] black [is attributed], as [it is] existing
in re
(
mawjūdun
fī al-a‘yān
). Thus,
if
being black
is an existential attribute
(
waṣf
), then
black
is [called] an existential
description (
ṣifa
). (
On Existence
,
Jamshīd Nijād Awwal (ed.) 2000, 102)
Accordingly, an existential attribute is something that exists
in
re
as an additional attribute of its subject. This point, i.e.
being additional to the subject as it exists
in re
, is
crucial to Khayyam’s formulation of existential attributes since
considerational attributes are only additional to their subject
in
intellectu
(or, more specifically, in the intellect or in the
estimative faculty). Khayyam finds existential attributes easily
understandable and then quickly moves to introduce considerational
 attributes:
[
7
]
If the intellect intellects a meaning (
ma‘nā
) and
details that intelligible [meaning] in an intelligible manner and
considers its status/conditions (
al-aḥwāl
), if
that meaning happens/occurs to some simple, not multiple, [meaning]
like all existing accidents
in re
(
fī
al-a‘yān
), and it [i.e., the simple meaning] happens
to have some attributes, then [the intellect] knows that all those
attributes belong to that [simple meaning] on the basis of
consideration, not on the basis of the existence
in re
.
(
On Existence
, Jamshīd Nijād Awwal (ed.) 2000,
103)
A considerational attribute is an intelligible meaning whose subject
of attribution is another intelligible meaning that is simple, not
multiple,
in re
and has multiple attributes. These attributes
of the simple meaning are considerational attributes. This is because
simple things, with no multiplicity
in re
, are not
hylomorphically composite, that is, they are not composed of matter
and form. So, their attributes are not grounded on real multiplicity
or composition. And according to the Peripatetic philosophical school,
accidents (in the sense of the nine Aristotelian categories) are
simple
in re
, with no matter or form. If
black
is an
accident (quality),
being a color
is a considerational
attribute of that. Likewise, if
two
is an accident
(quantity),
being half of four
is a considerational attribute
of that as well. Let us explain these two examples in more detail.
Considerational attributes, as well as existential ones, come in two
varieties: essential and accidental. Khayyam illustrates both cases.
An example of an essential considerational attribute is
being a
color
as an attribute of
black
. Conceiving
being a
color
is conceptually prior to conceiving
black
and is
the cause of
black
, that is,
being a color
is
essentially prior to
black
(or
white
). Furthermore,
an existential attribute of a subject is additional to its essence.
But
black
itself is an accident and, here Khayyam seems to
assume that, no accident can be the subject (in the metaphysical
sense) of another accident. Finally,
being a color
and
black
cannot be accidents of the same subject because if this
were the case, then
black
could come apart from
being a
color
, at least in estimation, but this is impossible. So,
being a color
is an essential considerational attribute of
black
(
On Existence
, Jamshīd Nijād Awwal
(ed.) 2000, 103–4). An example of an
accidental
considerational attribute is
being half of four
as an
attribute of
two
. Conceiving
being
half of
four
is not conceptually prior to conceiving
two
, nor is
being half of four
the cause of
two
. So,
being
half of four
is not an essential attribute of
two
.
Hence,
being half of four
is an accidental attribute of two.
Furthermore, an existential attribute of a subject is additional to
its essence. If
being half of four
were something additional
(
za’id
) to
two
(
in re
), then
two
would have infinite meanings added to its essence (
in
re
). But this is impossible, according to Khayyam. Therefore,
being half of four
is not an accidental existential attribute
of
two
. Therefore,
being half of four
is an
accidental considerational attribute of
two
(
On
Existence
, Jamshīd Nijād Awwal (ed.) 2000,
102–3). (This example suggests that
two
, as an
accident, is a
simple
meaning, with no matter or form, even
though it is true of two entities.)
By way of analogy, and in some respects, the problem of
considerational vs. existential attributes, as Khayyam discusses, is
like the problem of non-natural vs. natural properties in contemporary
analytic philosophy. This semantic division plays a significant
metaphysical role in Khayyam’s metaphysics, to which we shall
turn next.
2.7 Existence (
wujūd
) and Essence (
māhiyyah
)
Khayyam offers a series of arguments for the thesis that
“existence is a ‘considerational’ attribute”
(
On Existence
, Jamshīd Nijād Awwal (ed.) 2000, 106;
The Light of the Intellect
, Nadvi (ed.) 1933 [2010,
347–9]). In section seventeen of
On Existence
, entitled
“Existence is an added meaning (
ma‘nā
) to
the intelligible essence,” he writes, “And it is as if
[the soul/intellect] encounters existence in all things, by way of
accidents, and there is no doubt that existence is a meaning added to
the intelligible essence” (
On Existence
, Jamshīd
Nijād Awwal (ed.) 2000, 111). By “by way of
accidents” Khayyam should mean
as a form of accident
,
and “accident” should be used here in the sense of
predicable
, not one of the nine Aristotelian categories of
accidents. The “additionality” should also mean
“being additional
in intellectu
,” not
in
re
. By relying on
reductio ad absurdum
, he concludes
that if
existence
were to be an existential attribute, it
would have to exist prior to itself, which is impossible. Khayyam
states “essence (
ḏāt
) was non-existent and
then became existent.” He goes on to argue that “essence
does not need existence [before coming to existence] or a relation to
existence because the essence prior to existing was non-existing
(
ma‛dūm
), thus how can something need something
else prior to its existence?” (
On Existence
,
Jamshīd Nijād Awwal (ed.) 2000, 110). Towards the end of
this treatise he uses the Neoplatonic scheme of emanation to explain
the origin of essences and states: “Therefore, it became clear
that all essences (
ḏawāt
) and quiddities
(
māhiyyāt
) emanate from the essence of the First
Exalted Origin, in an orderly fashion, may glory be upon Him”
(
On Existence
, Jamshīd Nijād Awwal (ed.) 2000,
118).
In Aminrazavi and Van Brummelen (2017) earlier edition of this entry,
as well as in Nasr
 (
The Poet Scientist Khayyam as Philosopher
)
 and Aminrazavi 2007, 168–71), it is suggested that
“Clearly Khayyam supports the principality of essence”
(i.e., the second view) among the following three views:
The existence of an existent is the same as its essence. This view
is attributed to Abu’l-Ḥasan Ash‘arī,
Abu’l-Ḥasan Baṣrī, and some of the other
Ash‘arite theologians.
Commonly known as the principality of essence
(
a
ṣālat al-māhiyyah
), this view
maintains that essence is primary and existence is added to it. Many
philosophers such as Abū Hāshim Jubā’ī and
later Suhrawardī and Mīr Dāmād came to advocate
this view.
Commonly known as the principality of existence
(
a
ṣālat al-wujūd
), this view
maintains that existence is primary and essence is then added
(Aminrazavi 2007, 168).
Nasr
 (
The Poet Scientist Khayyam as Philosopher
)
 who prefers the same reading, that is “Khayyam asserts that for
each existent, it is the quiddity that is principal while
wujud
is a conceptual (
i‘tibari
)
quality,” immediately qualifies his view by adding that
“the distinction between the principality of
wujud
(
asalat
al-wujud)
and the principality of
mahiyyah
(
asalat
al-mahiyyah
) goes back to
the School of Isfahan and especially Mulla Sadra,” and Khayyam
“does not use the term
asalat
al-mahiyyah
as
was done by Mullā Ṣadrā.” We find Nasr’s
comment on the notion of “principality” important and take
it to indicate that there may be room to argue that not only the term
“principality of quiddity” but also the corresponding
concept is absent from Khayyam’s philosophical treatises. What
one finds in Khayyam’s work is a series of arguments for the
thesis that existence is a considerational (or “secondary”
as translated by Aminrazavi) attribute. If one further grants the
conditional claim that if existence is a considerational attribute,
then quiddity is principal (in the sense at stake in the debate over
the principality of existence vs. the principality of quiddity in the
post Isfahan school). Thus, one might derive the conclusion that
Khayyam supports the principality of quiddity. The latter conditional
presumption, however, is in need of a sound argument, and as far we
can see, no such argument has yet been provided.
Aminrazavi and Van Brummelen (2017) then explain that “a more
careful reading reveals an interesting twist: namely, that
Khayyam’s understanding of how essences came to be casts doubt
on his belief in the principality of essence” (Note: we have
translated
al-māhiyyah
as “quiddity,” not
“essence”). This comment may strengthen our hypothesis
that Khayyam does not support the principality of quiddity in the
first place, at least in the sense rejected by Mullā
Ṣadrā and his followers. Perhaps Khayyam does not offer an
argument against it either (if he does not work with the notion of
principality
in question). Aminrazavi and Van Brummelen
(2017) then continue: “Towards the end of the
Risālah
fi’l-wujūd
he uses the Neoplatonic scheme of emanation
to explain the origin of essences [...] Khayyam replaces essence with
existence here and the question is whether he equates them and thereby
deviates from his teacher Ibn Sīnā. [...] It appears that
Khayyam equates existence and essence as having emanated from God in
an orderly fashion, but there is no explanation of how essence becomes
primary and existence secondary. In fact, if existence did not exist
how could essences come to be?” After discussing all these
“problems,” they conclude: “Although the distinction
between the principality of
wujūd
(
aṣālat
al-wujūd
) and the principality of
māhiyyah
(
aṣālat al-māhiyyah
) can be found among early
Muslim philosophers, the subject matter became particularly
significant in later Islamic philosophy, especially through the School
of Iṣfahān and the work of its most outstanding figure,
Mullā Ṣadrā. This is important for our discussion
since Umar Khayyam may simply have presented the arguments for and
against the priority and posterity of essence and existence without
attaching much significance to their philosophical consequences, as
was the case in later Islamic philosophy” (Aminrazavi and Van
Brummelen 2017).
The above concerns and the ensuing questions are based on the
assumption that Khayyam supports the principality of quiddity, which
in turn stems from casting a post Iṣfahān school conceptual
framework on Khayyam’s philosophy. This latter interpretational
strategy, however, requires proper doctrinal and textual
justification. In the absence of such evidence, Khayyam’s view
that existence is a considerational attribute does not seem to imply
the principality of quiddity and hence may not be subject to the above
criticisms.
In
The Light of the Intellect
, Khayyam offers three reasons
why existence is not added to essence
in re
. A summary of his
reasons goes as follows:
Existence cannot be added to essence
in re
; otherwise an
infinite regress will follow, which is untenable.
Existence is not added to essence
in re
; otherwise
essence should have existed prior to its existence, and this is
absurd.
With regard to the Necessary Existence, existence clearly is not
added to essence
in re
, for dualism would follow.
Some have also read
The Light of the Intellect
as providing
an argument for the principality of essence (or quiddity); we believe
such readings face problems similar to the ones discussed above. This
treatise reconfirms the view that Khayyam believes that
existence
,
oneness
, and many other key metaphysical
and scientific attributes (e.g.,
color
), are considerational,
not existential, attributes.
Khayyam’s philosophical works are the least studied aspects of
his thought, and were not even available in published form until a few
years ago. They permit a fresh look at overall Khayyamian thought and
prove indispensable to an understanding of his
Rubā‘iyyāt
. In his philosophical works,
Khayyam writes as a Muslim philosopher and treats a variety of
traditional philosophical problems in a careful manner; but in his
Rubā‘iyyāt
, our Muslim philosopher morphs
into an agnostic Epicurean, or so it seems. A detailed study of
Khayyam’s philosophical works reveals several explanations for
this dichotomy, the most likely of which is the conflict between pure
and practical reasoning. Whereas such questions as theodicy, the
existence of God, soul and the possibility of life after death may be
argued for philosophically, such arguments hardly seem relevant to the
human condition, given our daily share of suffering.
It is in light of the distinction between “is” and
“ought,” the “ideal” and the
“actual,” that discrepancies between Khayyam’s
Rubā‘iyyāt
and his philosophical views should
be understood. Khayyam’s
Rubā‘iyyāt
are
the works of a sober philosopher and not those of a hedonistic poet.
Whereas Khayyam the philosopher-mathematician justifies theism based
on the existing order in the universe, Khayyam the poet, for whom
suffering in the world remains insoluble, does not talk about theism,
or any type of eschatological doctrine, as a solution to the problem
of the meaning of human existence.
3. The
Rubā‘iyyāt
(
Quatrains
)
Here with a Loaf of Bread beneath the Bough,
A Flask of Wine, a Book of Verse—and Thou
Beside me singing in the Wilderness—
And Wilderness is Paradise enow.
(
Rubā‘iyyāt
, FitzGerald
1859, 30; 2009, 21)
Although Umar Khayyam’s
Rubā‘iyyāt
have
been admired in the Persian speaking world for many centuries, they
have only been known in the West widely since the mid 19
th
century, when Edward FitzGerald rendered the
Rubā‘iyyāt
into English.
The word Ruba‘ī (plural:
Rubā‘iyyāt
), meaning “quatrain,”
comes from the word
al-Rābi‘
, the number four in
Arabic. It refers to a poetic form which consists of a four-lined
stanza and two hemistiches for a total of four parts.
Tarānah
(snatch) and
dobaītī
(two-liner) are very similar to quatrains; they differ from each other
in terms of rhyme scheme and themes or message. They all have a short
and simple form that provides a type of “poetic punch
line.”
The overwhelming majority of the literary works on the
Rubā‘iyyāt
have been devoted to the
monumental task of determining the authentic
Rubā‘iyyāt
from the inauthentic ones. In our
current discussion, we shall bypass that controversy and rely on the
most authoritative
Rubā‘iyyāt
in order to
provide a commentary on Khayyam’s critique of the fundamental
tenets of organized religion(s). The salient features of his critique
address the following:
Impermanence and the quest for the meaning of life
Theodicy
The here and now
Epistemology
Eschatology
Determinism and free will
Philosophical wisdom
3.1 Impermanence and the quest for the meaning of life
The
Rubā‘
iyyāt
’s overarching
theme is the temporality of human existence and the suffering that one
endures during a seemingly senseless existence. Clearly, such a view
based on his observation of the world around him is in sharp contrast
with the Islamic view presented in the Quran: “I (Allah) have
not created the celestial bodies and the earth in vain” (Quran,
38:27). Umar Khayyam was caught between the rationalistic tradition of
the Peripatetics deeply entrenched in the Islamic religious universe
and his own failure to find any meaning or purpose in human existence
on a more immediate and experiential level. Khayyam the poet
criticizes the meaninglessness of life whereas Khayyam the philosopher
remains loyal to the Islamic Peripatetic tradition which adheres to a
theocentric world view.
Using the imagery of a
kuzah
(“jug”) and clay
throughout the
Rubā‘iyyāt
, Khayyam alludes to
the temporality of life and its
 senselessness:
[
8
]
I saw the potter in the market yesterday
Pounding and pounding upon a piece of clay
“Behold,” said the clay to the potter
Treat me gently for once like you, now I am clay
(translation by Aminrazavi)
The above verse, for example, may be read as suggesting that Khayyam
does not see a profound meaning in human existence; his existential
anxiety is compounded by the fact that we are subject to our daily
share of suffering, a concept that runs contrary to that of the all
merciful and compassionate God of Islam.
3.2 Theodicy and Justice
The problem of suffering has an ominous presence in the
Rubā‘iyyāt
, which contains both Epicurean and
Stoic themes. On theodicy, Khayyam remarks:
In what life yields in this Two-door monastery
Your share in the pain of heart and death will tarry
The one who does not bear a child is happy
And he not born of a mother, merry
(translation by Aminrazavi)
And also:
Life is dark and maze-like, it is
Suffering cast upon us and comfort in abyss
Praise the Lord for all the means of evil
Ask none other than He for malice
(translation by Aminrazavi)
(It is an irony that while Khayyam complains about theodicy and human
suffering throughout his
Rubā‘iyyāt
, in his
philosophical works he offers a treatise almost entirely devoted to a
philosophical justification of the problem of evil.) It might seem
that theodicy as a theological and philosophical problem in Islam
never received the attention it did in Western intellectual tradition;
however, a series of problems associated with evil have been discussed
under different names in this tradition. In the discussion of
Tawḥīd
, absolute oneness and unity of God in
Islam, the problem of existence of evil, particularly the manner in
which evil is created by God, is discussed (see section 2.4 above). In
the debate over God’s attribute of justice, between the
Asharites and the Muʿtazilites, some aspects of the problem of
evil, e.g., whether our morally wrong actions are ultimately created
by God or attributed to him, are carefully examined as well. Also, in
the discussion of relative and negative (privative) attributes, the
question of the nature of evil is raised again. Khayyam’s poem
seems to acknowledge both the reality and malicious nature of evil and
the ensuing suffering, on the one hand, and God’s role in
allowing evil and his “answerability,” on the other hand.
This makes questioning God on the existence of evil not illegitimate:
“Ask none other than He for malice.”
3.3 Here and Now
For Khayyam the poet, “the tale of the seventy-two
nations,” by which he refers to organized branches of Islam, and
of religions in general, and traditional metaphysical beliefs (mainly
Platonic and neo-Platonic), are merely flight of fancy, for the human
condition, which he describes as a “sorrow laden nest,” at
least in part contradicts many such beliefs. The art of living in the
present, a theme dealt with in Sufi literature, is a type of wisdom
that must be acquired, since living for the hereafter and heavenly
rewards is conventional wisdom, and more suitable for the masses. On
this point, Khayyam asserts:
Today is thine to spend, but not to-morrow,
Counting on morrow breedeth naught but sorrow;
Oh! Squander not this breath that heaven hath lent thee,
Nor make too sure another breath to borrow
(Whinfield 2001, 30; modified by Aminrazavi)
And also:
What matters if I feast, or have to fast?
What if my days in joy or grief are cast?
Fill me with Thee, O Guide! I cannot ken
If breath I draw returns or fails at last.
(Whinfield 2001, 144)
Khayyam’s emphasis on living in the present, or as Sufis say,
“Sufi is the son of time,” along with his use of other
Sufi metaphors such as wine, intoxication and love making, have been
interpreted by some scholars as merely mystical
 allegories.
[
9
]
Although a mystical interpretation of the
Rubā‘iyyāt
has been advocated by some, it
remains the view of a minority of scholars.
The complexity of the world according to Khayyam the
mathematician-astronomer necessitates the existence of a creator and
sustainer of the universe; and yet on a more immediate and existential
level, he finds no reason or meaning for human existence. He seems to
want to hold both the idea of “a necessary existence” and
what necessarily follows from it (as a divine character is always
present and sometimes critically addressed in his quatrains) and the
immediate intuition of the presence of apparently unexplainable
suffering, evil, and meaninglessness in this world. This leads to the
theme of doubt and bewilderment. A practical response to this
existential crisis opens room for a number of Epicurean and Stoic
themes in Khayyam’s view, such as being “the son of
time,” or the art of living in presence.
3.4 Doubt and Bewilderment
Humans, Khayyam tells us, are thrown into an existence they cannot
make sense of:
The sphere upon which mortals come and go,
Has no end nor beginning that we know;
And none there is to tell us in plain truth:
Whence do we come and whither do we go.
(Whinfield 2001, 132)
Again, the vivid and apparent inconsistency between a seemingly
senseless existence and a complex and orderly world leads to
existential and philosophical doubt and bewilderment. The tension
between Khayyam’s philosophical writings in which he embraces
the Islamic Peripatetic philosophical tradition and his
Rubā‘iyyāt
where he expresses his profound
skepticism stems from this paradox. In his
Rubā‘iyyāt
Khayyam embraces, or comes very
close to embracing, humanism and agnosticism, leaving the individual
human being disoriented, anxious and bewildered; whereas in his
philosophical writings he operates within a theistic world where the
most fundamental questions, like the existence of God and explanation
of evil, find (relatively) decisive solutions. Lack of certainty with
regard to religious truth leaves the individual in an
epistemologically suspended state where one has to live in the here
and now, irrespective of the question of truth:
Since neither truth nor certitude is at hand
Do not waste your life in doubt for a fairyland
O let us not refuse the goblet of wine
For, sober or drunken, in ignorance we stand
(translation by Aminrazavi)
This skepticism towards organized religions runs deep in
Khayyam’s quatrains; he explicitly questions the orthodoxy and
how the final disclosure of ultimate truth might be surprising to all
“believers,” and perhaps “nonbelievers” (note:
your reward is neither
here
nor
there
):
Alike for those who for To-day prepare,
And those that after a To-morrow stare,
A Muezzín from the Tower of Darkness cries
“Fools! your Reward is neither Here nor There!”
(
Rubā‘iyyāt
, FitzGerald
2009, 28)
3.5 Eschatology
The
Rubā‘iyyāt
casts doubt on Islamic
eschatological and soteriological views. Once again the tension
between Khayyam’s poetic and philosophical modes of thought
surfaces; experientially there is evidence to conclude that death is
the end:
Behind the curtain none has found his way
None came to know the secret as we could say
And each repeats the dirge his fancy taught
Which has no sense-but never ends the lay
(Whinfield 2001, 229)
In the
Rubā‘iyyāt
, Khayyam portrays the
universe as a beautiful ode which reads “from dust we come and
to dust we return,” and “every brick is made from the
skull of a man.” While Khayyam does not explicitly deny the
existence of life after death, perhaps for political reasons and fear
of being labeled a heretic, there are subtle references throughout his
Rubā‘iyyāt
that the hereafter should be taken
with a grain of salt. In contrast, in his philosophical writings we
see him argue for the incorporeality of the soul, which paves the path
for the existence of life after death. The irreconcilable conflict
between Khayyam’s observation that death is the inevitable end
for all beings, and his philosophical reflections in favor of the
possibility of the existence of life after death, remains an insoluble
 riddle.
[
10
]
3.6 Free Will, Determinism and Predestination
Khayyam is known as a determinist in both the East and the West, and
deterministic themes can be seen in much of the
Rubā‘iyyāt
. But if we read his
Rubā‘iyyāt
together with his philosophical
writings, the picture that emerges may be more rightly called
“soft determinism.” One of Khayyam’s best known
quatrains in which determinism is clearly conveyed asserts:
The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
Moves on: nor all your Piety nor Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
Nor all your Tears wash out a Word of it
(
Rubā‘iyyāt
, FitzGerald
1859, 20)
Again, in his philosophical treatise
The Necessity of
Contrariety
, Khayyam adheres to three types of determinism. On a
universal or cosmic level, our birth is determined in the sense that
we had no choice in this matter. Ontologically speaking, our essence
and our place on the overall hierarchy of beings appears also to be
predetermined. However, the third category of determinism,
socio-economic determinism, is man-made and thus changeable. Our
attempt to face this determined end of our life, however, will again
lead us to nowhere but bewilderment:
At first they brought me perplexed in this way
Amazement still enhances day by day
We all alike are tasked to go but Oh!
Why are we brought and sent? This none can say
(
Rubā‘iyyāt
, Tirtha 1941,
18)
Thus a reading of the
Rubā‘iyyāt
in
conjunction with Khayyam’s philosophical reflections bring
forward a more sophisticated view of free will and determinism,
indicating that Khayyam believed in free will within a form of cosmic
determinism and did not support a full-blown predeterminism.
3.7 Philosophical Wisdom
Khayyam uses the concept of “wine and intoxication”
throughout his
Rubā‘iyyāt
in three distinct
ways:
The intoxicant wine
The mystical wine
The wine of wisdom
The pedestrian use of wine in the
Rubā‘iyyāt
,
devoid of any intellectual significance, emphasizes the need to forget
our daily suffering. The mystical allusions to wine pertain to a type
of intoxication which stands opposed to discursive thought. The
esoteric use of wine and drinking, which has a long history in Persian
Sufi literature, refers to the state of ecstasy in which one is
intoxicated with Divine love. Those supporting the Sufi interpretation
of
Rubā‘iyyāt
rely on this literary genre.
While Khayyam was not a Sufi in the traditional sense of the word, he
includes the mystical use of wine among his allusions.
Khayyam’s use of wine in the profound sense in his
Rubā‘iyyāt
is a type of Sophia that provides
a sage with philosophical wisdom, allowing one to come to terms with
the temporality of life and to live in the here and now:
Those imprisoned by the intellect’s need to decipher
Humbled; knowing being from non-being, they proffer
Seek ignorance and drink the juice of the grape
Those fools acting as wise, scoffer.
(translation by Aminrazavi)
Khirad
is the type of wisdom that brings about a
rapprochement between the poetic and discursive modes of thought, one
that sees the fundamental irony in what appears to be a senseless
human existence within an orderly and complex physical universe. For
Khayyam the mathematician-astronomer, the universe cannot be the
result of a random chance; on the other hand, Khayyam the poet fails
to find any purpose for an individual human existence in this orderly
universe.
As Spring and Fall make their appointed turn,
The leaves of life one aft another turn;
Drink wine and brood not—as the Sage has said:
“Life’s cares are poison, wine the cure in turn.”
(
Rubā‘iyyāt

4. Khayyam the Mathematician and Scientist
And the part of philosophy known as
mathematics
is the
easiest of its parts to grasp both as to conception and as to assent.
As to the numerical part of it, it is a very evident matter. And as to
the geometrical, likewise hardly anything of it will be unknown to
someone who has an unimpaired constitution, a sharp view, an excellent
intuition. (
Commentary on the Difficulties of Certain Postulates
of Euclid’s Work
, Rashed and Vahabzadeh, 2000,
217–218).
In several respects Khayyam’s mathematical writings are similar
to his texts in other genres: they are relatively few in number, but
deal with well-chosen topics and carry deep implications. Some of his
mathematics relate in passing to philosophical matters (in particular,
reasoning from postulates and definitions), but his most significant
work deals with issues internal to mathematics and in particular the
intersection between geometry and algebra.
Khayyam’s mathematical works with recent editions and
publications are:

4.1 Solutions of Cubic Equations
Khayyam seems to have been attracted to cubic equations originally
through his consideration of the following geometric problem: in a
quadrant of a circle, drop a perpendicular from some point on the
circumference to one of the radii so that the ratio of the
perpendicular to the radius is equal to the ratio of the two parts of
the radius on which the perpendicular falls. In the short
“Treatise on the division of a quadrant of a circle,”
Khayyam leads us from one case of this problem to the equation \(x^3 +
200x = 20x^2 +
 2000\).
[
11
]
Khayyam states that an exact solution is not possible and provides an
approximation. Khayyam also generates a direct geometric solution: he
uses the numbers in the equation to determine intersecting curves of
two conic sections (a circle and a hyperbola) and demonstrates that
the solution \(x\) is equal to the length of a particular line segment
in the diagram.
Solving algebraic problems using geometric tools was not new; in the
case of quadratic equations these geometric methods date back as far
as the Greeks and even to the Babylonians. Khayyam’s
predecessors such as al-Khwārizmī (early 9
th
century) and Thābit ibn Qurra (late 9
th
century)
already had solved quadratic equations using the straightedge and
compass geometry of Euclid’s
Elements
. Since negative
numbers were avoided in Arabic mathematics, Muslim mathematicians
needed to solve several different types of quadratic equations with
positive coefficients: for instance, \(x^2 = mx + n\) was
fundamentally different from \(x^2 + mx = n\). For cubic equations,
fourteen distinct types of equations cannot be reduced to a linear or
quadratic form after dividing by \(x\) or \(x^2\). In his
“Treatise on
 Algebra”
[
12
]
Khayyam notes that four of these fourteen types had been solved and
says that al-Khāzin (ca. 900–971) had solved a problem from
Archimedes’ treatise
On the Sphere and Cylinder
that
al-Māhānī (fl. ca. 860) had previously converted into a
cubic equation and solved using conic sections. Khayyam also states
that al-Layth (fl. 10
th
century) had not treated these
cubic forms exhaustively.
In the
Algebra
, Khayyam claims to be the first to deal
systematically with all fourteen types of cubic equations. He solves
each one in turn, again through the use of intersecting conic
sections. Khayyam also considers circumstances when certain cubic
equations have multiple solutions. Although he does not handle this
topic perfectly, his effort nonetheless exceeds previous efforts. In
an algebra where powers of \(x\) corresponded to geometrical
dimensions, the solution of cubic equations was the apex of the
discipline. Nevertheless, even here Khayyam advanced algebra by
considering its unknowns as dimension-free abstractions of continuous
 quantities.
[
13
]
A geometric solution to a polynomial equation may seem peculiar to
modern eyes, but the study of cubic equations (and indeed much of
medieval algebra) was motivated by geometric problems. Khayyam was
explicitly aware that the algebraic solution of the cubic equation
remained to be solved. He never produced such a solution, nor did
anyone else until Scipione del Ferro, Niccolò Fontana
Tartaglia, and Gerolamo Cardano in the mid-16
th
century.
Khayyam’s work intersecting algebra and geometry is a precursor
to the analytic geometry popularized in Descartes’
La
Géométrie
published in 1637. Descartes’
La Géométrie
refines and generalizes
Khayyam’s methods and forms a bridge from the medieval
mathematics of Khayyam to the modern mathematics of Newton and Leibniz
(Rashed and Vahabzadeh, 2000, 20–29).
4.2 The Parallel Postulate and the Theory of Ratios
The process of reasoning from postulates and definitions has been
basic to mathematics at least since the time of Euclid. Islamic
geometers were well versed in this art, but also spent some effort
examining the logical foundations of the method. They were unafraid to
revise and improve upon Euclid’s starting points, and they
rebuilt Euclid’s
Elements
from the foundation in
several ways. Khayyam’s “Commentary on the Difficulties of
Certain Postulates of Euclid’s

Work​​​​”​
[
14
]
deals with the two most important issues in this context, the
parallel postulate and the definition of equality of ratios.
Euclid’s fifth “parallel” postulate states that if a
line falls on two given lines such that the two interior angles add up
to less than two right angles, then the given lines must meet on that
side. This statement is logically equivalent to several more easily
understood assertions, such as: there is exactly one parallel to a
given line that passes through a given point not on the given line;
or, the angles of a triangle sum to two right angles. It has been
known since the early 19
th
century that non-Euclidean
geometries violate these properties; indeed, it is not yet known
whether the space in which we live satisfies them.
The parallel postulate, however, was not subject to doubt at
Khayyam’s time, so it is more appropriate to think of Islamic
efforts in this area as part of the tradition of improving upon Euclid
rather than as the origin of non-Euclidean geometry. Khayyam’s
reconstruction of Euclid is one of the better ones: he does not try to
prove the parallel postulate. Rather, he replaces it with two
statements, which he attributes to
 Aristotle,
[
15
]
that are both simpler and more self-evident: two lines that converge
must intersect, and two lines that converge can never diverge in the
direction of convergence. Khayyam then replaces Euclid’s
29
th
proposition, the first in which the parallel postulate
is used, with a new sequence of eight propositions. Khayyam’s
insertion amounts to determining that the so-called Saccheri
quadrilateral (one with two equal sides perpendicular to the base) is
in fact a rectangle. As Giovanni Girolamo Saccheri published this
quadrilateral in his book
Euclides ab omni naevo vindicatus
in 1733, it is also known as the Khayyam-Saccheri quadrilateral.
Khayyam believed his approach was an improvement on that of his
predecessor Ibn al-Haytham (ca. 965–1040) because his method
does not rely on the concept of motion, which Khayyam said should be
excluded from geometry. Apparently Naṣīr al-Dīn
al-Ṭūsī agreed, since he followed Khayyam’s path
in the next century (Rashed and Vahabzadeh, 2000, 186).
Book II of “Commentary on the Difficulties of Certain Postulates
of Euclid’s Work” takes up the question of the proper
definition of ratio. This topic is obscure to the modern reader, but
it was fundamental to Greek and medieval mathematics. If the
quantities joined in a ratio are whole numbers, then the definition of
their ratio poses no difficulty. If the quantities are geometric
magnitudes, the situation is more complicated because the two line
segments might be incommensurable (in modern terms, their ratio
corresponds to an irrational number). Euclid, following Eudoxus,
asserts that \(A/B = C/D\) when, for any magnitudes \(x\) and \(y\),
the magnitudes \(xA\) and \(xC\) are both (i) greater than, (ii) equal
to, or (iii) less than the magnitudes \(yB\) and \(yD\) respectively.
There is little wonder that Khayyam and others were unhappy with this
definition, for while it is clearly true, it does not get at the heart
of what it means for ratios to be equal.
An alternate approach, which may have existed in ancient Greece but
certainly existed in the 9
th
century, is the
“anthyphairetic” definition (Hogendijk 2002). The
Euclidean algorithm is an iterative process that is used to find the
greatest common divisor of a pair of numbers. The algorithm may be
applied equally well to find the greatest common measure of two
geometric magnitudes, but the algorithm will never terminate if the
ratio between the two magnitudes is irrational. A sequence of
divisions within the algorithm results in a “continued
fraction” that corresponds to the ratio between the original two
quantities. Khayyam, following several earlier Islamic mathematicians,
defines the equality of \(A/B\) and \(C/D\) according to whether their
continued fractions are equal.
One may wonder why the proponents of the anthyphairetic definition
felt that it was more natural than Euclid’s approach. There is
no doubt, however, that it was preferred; Khayyam even refers to the
anthyphairetic definition as the “true” nature of
proportionality. Part of the explanation might be simply that the
Euclidean algorithm applied to geometric quantities was much more
familiar to medieval mathematicians than to us. Khayyam’s
preference is due to the fact that the anthyphairetic definition
allows a ratio to be considered on its own, rather than always in
equality to some other ratio. Khayyam’s achievement in this
topic was not to invent a new definition, but rather to demonstrate
that each of the existing definitions logically implies the other.
Thus Islamic mathematicians could continue to use ratio theorems from
the
Elements
without having to prove them again according to
the anthyphairetic definition.
Book III continues the discussion of ratios; Khayyam sets himself the
task of demonstrating the seemingly innocuous proposition \(A/C =
(A/B) (B/C)\), a fact which is used in the
Elements
but never
proved. During this process Khayyam sets an arbitrary fixed magnitude
to serve as a unit, to which he relates all other magnitudes of the
same kind. This arrangement allows Khayyam to incorporate both numbers
and geometric magnitudes within the same system. Thus Khayyam thinks
of irrational magnitudes as numbers themselves, which effectively
defines the set of “real numbers” that we take for granted
today which is composed of rational numbers together with irrational
numbers. This revolutionary step to consider irrational numbers as
mathematical entities in their own right was one of the most
significant advances of conception to occur between ancient Greek and
modern mathematics (Youschkevitch and Rosenfeld 1973, 327).
4.3 Root Calculations and the Binomial Theorem
We know that Khayyam wrote a treatise, now lost, titled
“Problems of Arithmetic,” involving the determination of
\(n\)-th roots (Youschkevitch and Rosenfeld 1973, 325–326). In
his
Algebra
Khayyam writes that methods for calculating
square and cube roots come from India, and that he is the first to
extend these methods to the determination of roots of any order
(Rashed and Vahabzadeh 2000, 6). Even more interestingly, Khayyam
states that he has demonstrated the validity of his methods using
proofs that “are only numerical demonstrations based on the
arithmetical Books of the
Elements
” (Rashed and
Vahabzadeh 2000, 116–117). If both of these statements are true,
then it is hard to avoid the conclusion that Khayyam had used the
binomial theorem
\[(a + b)^n = a^n + na^{n-1}b + \cdots + nab^{n-1}+ b^n\]
in his method, improving on and extending Abū Bakr
al-Karajī’s (ca. 953–1029) work on binomial
expansions. “Pascal’s” celebrated arithmetic
triangle is a triangular arrangement of the binomial expansion
terms’ coefficients. Scholars such as Chāvoshī
advocate renaming Pascal’s triangle as
“al-Kharajī-Khayyam’s” triangle, given how
European mathematicians adopted the same method of extracting roots as
Khayyam’s (Chāvoshī 1380 A.H.s., 262–273).
The history of Pascal’s triangle appears to originate in India
with Acharya Pingala’s (ca. 200 BCE) study of meter and sound
combinations in Sanskrit poetry. The Indian commentator Halayudha
wrote a commentary on Pingala’s
Chandahsutra
at the end
of the 10
th
century CE giving the first appearance of a
triangular arrangement of the binomial coefficients, solely as a means
of finding the number of combinations of short and long syllable
patterns. Meanwhile in China, Jia Xian (ca. 1050) had also discovered
the method of finding \(n\)-th roots with Pascal’s triangle, as
relayed by the 13
th
century mathematician Yang Hui.
However, Jia Xian’s work is not extant. Thus, we rely on two
lost manuscripts, over approximately the same time period, to
determine the Islamic and Chinese origins of Pascal’s triangle
as a means for finding \(n\)-th roots (Joseph 2011, 247,
270–281, 354–355).
4.4 Astronomy and Other Works
Khayyam moved to Iṣfahān in 1074 to help establish a new
observatory under the patronage of Jalāl al-Din Malik-shāh,
the Seljuk sultan, and his vizier, Niẓām al-Mulk.
Undoubtedly, Khayyam played a major role in the creation of the
Malikī or Jalali calendar, the observatory’s most
significant project. Khayyam succeeded in devising a calendar more
accurate than the current Western Gregorian calendar, needing
correction of one day every 5,000 years compared to every 3,333 years
respectively. In addition to the calendar, the Iṣfahān
observatory produced the
Zīj Malik-shāhī
(of
which only a fragment of its star catalogue survives), apparently one
of the more important astronomical handbooks (Youschkevitch and
Rosenfeld 1973, 324).
Remaining works attributed to Khayyam in other fields are:
“Treatise on the Difficulties of the ‘Book of
Music’ (by Euclid)” (
Sharḥ al-mushkil min
kitāb al-musiqī
). Only one chapter titled
“Discussion on Genera Contained in a Fourth” (
Al-Qawl
‘alā ajnās allatī
bi’
l
-arba‘a
) is extant. For a
critical edition see Chāvoshī, “Omar al-Khayyam
wa’l-musiqī al-naḍariyyah,” translated into
English by M.M. ‘Abd al-Jalil,
Farhang
, vol. 1, 14
(1378 A.H.s.): 29–32 and 203–214.
“The Balance of Wisdoms” (
Mizān
al-ḥikmah
), “Two Treatises on the Level
Balance” (
Fi
’
l
-qusṭas
al-mustaqīm)
, and “On the Art of Determination of Gold
and Silver in a Body Consisting of Them” (
Risālah
fi’l- iḥtiyāj lima​‘rifat
miqdāṛī al-dhahab wa’l-fiḍah fī jism
murakkab minhā
) in
Dānish nāmah-yi
Khayyāmī
, Malik (ed.) 1377 A.H.s., 293–300, and
Persian trans., 301–304.
“On discovering the truth of Norūz”
(
Risālah dar kashf ḥaqiqat Norūz)
in
Dānish nāmah-yi Khayyāmī
, Malik (ed.)
1377 A.H.s., 424–438.
Book III of “Commentary on the Difficulties of Certain
Postulates of Euclid’s Work” shows Khayyam discussing how
compounding ratios in music composition are numerical. In this
discussion, Khayyam refers to his earlier commentary of Euclid’s
“Book of Music” (Rashed and Vahabzadeh, 2000,
251–252). However, only one chapter “Discussion on Genera
Contained in a Fourth” of Khayyam’s commentary discussing
tetrachords (a series of four notes separated by three intervals)
survives (Aminrazavi 2007, 198–199).
Khayyam’s treatise “On the Art of Determination of Gold
and Silver in a Body Consisting of Them” appears in the book
Mizān al-ḥikmah
written by his student
Abd’l-Raḥmān Khāzeni (fl. 1115–1130).
Khāzeni attributes this article, as well as the “Two
Treatises on the Level Balance,” to Khayyam. Techniques for
determining the proportions of gold and silver in a compound date back
to Archimedes, and Khayyam’s contribution appears to be the
precision of his method along with the intricate designs of his level
balance (Hall 1981, 341–343).
Another treatise titled “On discovering the truth of
Norūz” is apocryphal, where only one of its three parts is
believed to have been written by Khayyam. Khayyam allegedly writes of
the history and mythology of the Persian new year at the beginning of
the spring equinox, although the style and errors of the text lend
doubt to Khayyam’s authorship (Aminrazavi 2007, 38).
As with his philosophical and mathematical writings, Khayyam’s
texts in other disciplines appear to have been taken seriously by his
contemporaries and later scholars.
5. Khayyam in the West
5.1 Orientalism and the European Khayyam
The earliest extant translation of the
Rubā‘iyyāt
was produced by Thomas Hyde in the
1760s when his translation of a single quatrain appeared in the
Veterum Persarum et Parthorum et Medorum Religionis
. It was
not until the 19
th
century, however, that the Western world
and literary circles discovered Umar Khayyam in all his richness.
The voyage of the
Rubā‘iyyāt
to the West
began when Sir Gore Ouseley, the British ambassador to Iran, presented
his collection to the Bodleian Library at Oxford University upon his
return to England. In the 1840s Professor Edward Byles Cowell of
Oxford University discovered a copy of the
Ruba‘iyyat
of Khayyam and translated several of the
Rubā‘iyyāt
. Amazed by their profundity, he
shared them with Edward FitzGerald, who took an immediate interest and
published the first edition of his own translation in 1859. Four
versions of FitzGerald’s
Rubā‘iyyāt
were published over his lifetime as new quatrains were discovered.
Realizing the free nature of his work in his first translation,
FitzGerald chose the word
rendered
to appear on the title
page in later editions instead of “translation” (Lange
1968).
5.2 The Impact of Khayyam on Western Literary and Philosophical Circles
While the connection between the Pre-Raphaelites and Umar Khayyam
should not be exaggerated, the relationship that Algernon Charles
Swinburne, George Meredith, and Dante G. Rossetti shared with Edward
FitzGerald and their mutual admiration of Khayyam cannot be ignored.
The salient themes of the
Rubā‘iyyāt
became
popular among the Pre-Raphaelites and their circle (Lange 1968).
Khayyam’s popularity led to the formation of the “Omar
Khayyām Club of London” (Conway 1893, 305) in 1892, which
attracted a number of literary figures and intellectuals. The success
of the Club soon led to the simultaneous formation of the Omar
Khayyām Clubs of Germany and America.
In America, Umar Khayyam was well received in the New England area
where his poetry was propagated by the official members of the Omar
Khayyām Club of America. The academic community discovered
Khayyam’s mathematical writings and poetry in the 1880s, when
his scholarly articles and translations of his works were published.
Some, such as William Edward Story, praised Umar as a mathematician
and compared his views with those of Johannes Kepler, Gottfried
Wilhelm Leibniz, and Isaac Newton, while others drew their inspiration
from his literary tradition and called themselves
“Umarians.” This new literary movement soon attracted such
figures as Mark Twain, who composed forty-five burlesque versions of
FitzGerald’s quatrains and integrated them with two of
FitzGerald’s stanzas entitled
AGE-A Ruba‘iyat
(Twain, 1983, 14). The movement also drew the attention of T.S.
Eliot’s grandfather William Greenleaf Eliot (1811–1887),
two of T.S. Eliot’s cousins, and T.S. Eliot himself. Umar
Khayyam’s
Rubā‘iyyāt
seems to have
elicited two distinct responses among many of his followers in general
and the Eliot family in particular: admiration for a rational theology
on the one hand, and concern with the rise of skepticism and moral
decay in America on the other.
Among other figures influenced by the
Rubā‘iyyāt
of Umar Khayyam were certain
members of the New England School of Transcendentalism, including
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Ralph Waldo Emerson, and Henry David
Thoreau (Aminrazavi 2013; for a complete discussion on Umar Khayyam in
the West see Aminrazavi 2007, 204–278).
6. Conclusion
In the foregoing discussion, we have seen that Umar Khayyam was a
philosopher-sage (
ḥakīm
) and a
spiritual-pragmatist whose
Rubā‘iyyāt
should
be seen as a philosophical commentary on the human condition. The
salient features of Umar Khayyam’s pioneering work in various
branches of mathematics were also discussed. Khayyam’s
mathematical genius not only produced the most accurate calendar to
date, but the issues he treated remained pertinent up until the modern
period.
For Khayyam, there are two discourses, each of which pertains to one
dimension of human existence: philosophical and poetic.
Philosophically, Khayyam defended rationalism against the rise of
orthodoxy and made an attempt to revive the spirit of rationalism
which was so prevalent in the first four centuries in Islam.
Poetically, Khayyam represents a voice of protest against what he
regards to be a fundamentally unjust world. Many people found in him a
voice they needed to hear, and centuries after he had died, his works
became a venue for those who were experiencing the same trials and
tribulations as Khayyam had.

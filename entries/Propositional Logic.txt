Propositional Logic
First published Thu May 18, 2023
Propositional logic is the study of the meanings of, and the
inferential relationships that hold among, sentences based on the role
that a specific class of logical operators called the propositional
connectives have in determining those sentences’ truth or
assertability conditions. As early as Aristotle it was observed that
propositional connectives have a logical significance, and over many
centuries piecemeal observations about some of their properties were
made. But propositional logic
per se
did not emerge until the
nineteenth century with the appreciation of the value of studying the
behavior of propositional connectives in isolation of other
operators.
For example, a variation of the famous canonical syllogism where A is
the sentence “All men are mortal, and Socrates is a man”,
and B is the sentence “Socrates is mortal” can give rise
to a plurality of questions about the relationship between A and B.
Whether B follows logically from A ought not depend, it is thought, on
what words like “mortal” or “man” mean. But
one could reasonably ask either of the questions,
Does B follow from A purely by virtue of the meaning of the words
“and”, “is”, “are”,
“all”, and “a”?
and
Does B follow from A purely by virtue of the meaning of the word
“and”?
Intuitively, the answer to the first question is “yes”,
and the answer to the second question is “no”.
The example suggests that there is a right way to ask the question,
for surely B does follow logically from A. So when we want to ask if a
sentence follows logically, we should attend to the role of all words
such as “and”, “is”, “are”,
“all”, and “a”. Consider, however, if C is the
sentence “All men are mortal” and D is the sentence
“Socrates is a man”, that C also follows from A, but the
meanings of the words “is”, “are”,
“all”, and “a” play no role in the intuitive
verification of that fact. (Because A is just the sentence “C
and D”, nothing beyond an understanding of the meaning of the
word “and” is needed to see that A cannot be true without
C also being true.) It seems significant that B and C not only each
follow from A, but that they do so in different ways. The inference
from A to C is not only simpler or more direct than the inference to
B. In whatever sense B follows from A, so too does C, whereas there is
a stricter sense in which C, but not B, follows from A: Although both
B and C follow “logically” from A, the logical bond
between C and A is stronger than that between B and A. This highlights
the importance, not just of determinations about whether one sentence
follows from another, but of what standard of logicality underwrites
that determination.
Propositional logic is the study of just such a specification of a
standard of logicality, wherein only the meanings of the propositional
connectives (e.g., “and” in the example above, but not
“is”, “all”, etc.) are considered in
evaluating things such as the cogency of a deduction or a
sentence’s truth conditions.
A sentential connective is a linguistic particle that binds sentences
to create a new compound sentence or that inflects a single sentence
to create a new sentence. Among the sentential connectives, a
propositional connective has the characteristic feature that when the
original sentences it operates on are (or express) propositions, the
new sentence that results from its application also is (or expresses)
a proposition. There are, as one would expect, many competing theories
about what a proposition is, and propositional logic originated as a
scientific discipline independent of that debate. For this reason, the
precise demarcation of which linguistic particles qualify as
propositional connectives is somewhat vague and even contentious. But
the general heuristic is that a propositional connective must create
from some original sentences a new sentence that makes a claim of the
same order. Intuitively, because “A and B” is just an
affirmation of the content of A and the content of B, and “not
A” is just a denial of the content of A, “and” and
“not” are serving as propositional connectives. “It
is necessary that A”, on the other hand, is a claim not about
the content of A but about the sentence A itself. Similarly, “A
implies B” is a claim about the sentences A and B, that they
stand in an implication relationship with one another, rather than a
claim about the sort of thing that A and B themselves are claims
about. For this reason, the necessity qualifier and the implication
relation are typically not thought of as propositional connectives but
as modal operators. The conditional operator in such expressions as
“If A, then B” has not received a consensus: On some
analyses, this has been treated as a propositional connective, but on
others it cannot be.
In presenting propositional logic, we will not assume any particular
theory of propositions. As we will see, the development of and
plurality of systems of propositional logic can only be appreciated
when no particular conception of proposition is in place. The only
stipulations are that the connectives operate always on whole
sentences and never on sub-sentential items like predicates or terms,
and that they create sentences in the same evaluation class as the
ones they operate on, never higher-order expressions about the
sentences in that class.

1. Basic Framework
The formal language of propositional logic consists of
“atomic” propositional variables, \(p_1\), \(p_2\),
\(p_3\), …, and propositional connectives, \(c_1^1\),
\(c_2^1\), \(c_3^1\), …, \(c_1^2\), \(c_2^2\), \(c_3^2\),
…, \(c_1^3\), …. The expressions’ subscripts are
used to distinguish them from one another; the fact that we use
natural numbers indicates the typical convention that the vocabulary
be countable. The propositional connectives’ superscripts
indicate their “arity”, i.e., the number of propositions
that they operate on in order to create a new proposition. The
formulas of propositional logic are defined recursively by
Atomic propositional variables are formulas.
If \(c_n^m\) is a propositional connective, and \(\langle\)A, B, C,
…\(\rangle\) is a sequence of
m
, possibly but not
necessarily atomic, possibly but not necessarily distinct, formulas,
then the result of applying \(c_n^m\) to \(\langle\)A, B, C,
…\(\rangle\) is a formula.
The result of applying \(c_n^m\) to \(\langle\)A, B, C,
…\(\rangle\) is customarily written in functional notation:
\(c_n^m\)(A, B, C, …). Examples of formulas are
\(p_4\)
\(c_1^2(p_7, p_3)\)
\(c_2^2(c_1^1(p_1), c_1^1(c_1^2(p_2, p_3)))\)
\(c_5^3(p_2, c_3^2(c_4^1(c_6^2(p_3, p_3)), p_5),
c_9^1(p_2))\)
This recursive definition of the formulas of propositional logic
justifies the use of the label “atomic” for the
propositional variables: Every formula is built up stepwise from atoms
through a finite application of propositional connectives. It can be
helpful to think of the connectives as “propositional
functions” that take propositions (denoted by formulas) as input
and return propositions as output. The space of propositions is then
given as the free algebra on the atomic formulas generated by these
functions, and the specification of a proposition is given by the
standard “composition of functions” notation. This
terminology is not common, however, because the expression
“propositional function” has a quite different use of high
currency (see the entry on
Bertrand Russell
).
It is customary to indicate the specific connectives one is studying
with special characters, typically \(\wedge\), \(\vee\), \(\supset\),
\(\neg\), to use infix notation for binary connectives, and to display
parentheses only when there would otherwise be ambiguity. It is also
common to investigate properties of propositional formulas that do not
depend on the the occurrence of atoms fundamentally, in which case
formula variables A, B, C, etc. appear in the expression in place of
sentence letters. Thus if \(c_1^1\) is relabeled \(\neg\), \(c_1^2\)
is relabeled \(\wedge\), and \(c_2^2\) is relabeled \(\vee\), then in
place of the
third formula
listed above one would write \(\neg\rA\vee\neg(\rB\wedge\rC)\).
2. The Classical Interpretation
The logical analysis of propositional formulas proceeds from an
association of some meaning with the connectives, and there are
several ways of doing this. Because the original motivation for
studying propositional logic is the observation that some particles in
natural language often behave like propositional connectives, a
natural first move is to try to specify formal rules of inference or
precise assertability conditions that capture or approximate the role
that these natural language predicates serve in informal reasoning.
Two of the earliest specifications were in terms of truth functions
and in terms of axiomatic deduction systems. After considering these
in turn, we will compare the more sophisticated specifications given
by Gentzen’s calculi.
2.1 Truth-functionality
If \(\calV\) is a set of truth values, a function
\(\calV^n\longrightarrow\calV\) mapping
n
-tuples of truth
values to truth values is called an
n
-ary truth function. The
number of values in \(\calV\) is called the valence of the function
space. In the bivalent case, the truth values are denoted \(\bT\) and
\(\bF\), and one has the classical theory of truth. Observe that in
this classical function space are two 0-ary truth functions which,
following the conventions on indices for propositional connectives we
could denote \(f_1^0\) and \(f_2^0\), but are conventionally denoted
\(\top\) and \(\bot\), defined by \(\top=\bT\) and \(\bot=\bF\), and
four unary truth functions defined by
\[
\begin{aligned}
f_1^1(\bT)&=f_1^1(\bF)=\bT,\\
f_2^1(\bT) &=\bT, \\
f_2^1(\bF) &=\bF, \\
f_3^1(\bT) &=\bF, \\
f_3^1(\bF) &=\bT, \\
f_4^1(\bT) &=f_4^1(\bF)=\bF. \\
\end{aligned}
\]
One sees that \(f_1^1\) performs no operation on its input and is
essentially the same as \(\top\). \(f_4^1\) is similarly an impostor:
\(\bot\) dressed up as a unary function. One can quickly check that
the number of
n
-ary truth functions is \(2^{2^n}\)—there
being 2 possible output values on each of the \(2^n\) possible
n
-tuples of input values, and that at each stage, a number of
truth functions are impostors from lower arity. A case of special
interest are the sixteen binary truth functions, which one can fully
individuate by specifying their range on the 4 possible input
values:
input
\(\langle\bT, \bT\rangle\)
\(\langle\bT, \bF\rangle\)
\(\langle\bF, \bT\rangle\)
\(\langle\bF, \bF\rangle\)
\(f_1^2\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bT\)
\(f_2^2\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bF\)
\(f_3^2\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bT\)
\(f_4^2\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bF\)
\(f_5^2\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bT\)
\(f_6^2\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bF\)
\(f_7^2\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bT\)
\(f_8^2\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bF\)
\(f_9^2\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bT\)
\(f_{10}^2\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bF\)
\(f_{11}^2\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bT\)
\(f_{12}^2\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bF\)
\(f_{13}^2\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bT\)
\(f_{14}^2\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bT\)
\(\bF\)
\(f_{15}^2\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bT\)
\(f_{16}^2\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bF\)
\(\bF\)
One immediately recognizes the impostors \(f_1^2 = \top\), \(f_4^2 =
f_2^1\) acting on the first input value, \(f_6^2 = f_2^1\) acting on
the second input value, \(f_{11}^2 = f_3^1\) acting on the second
input value, \(f_{13}^2 = f_3^1\) action on the first value, and
\(f_{16}^2 = \bot\), leaving ten essentially new binary truth
functions.
The truth-functional analysis of propositional logic proceeds by
associating
n
-ary truth functions with the
n
-ary
propositional connectives. The classical case considered thus far,
where the truth value space is bivalent, admits a strikingly simple
analysis. Observe first that the functions \(f_1^3\), \(f_2^2\), and
\(f_2^8\) approximate the truth conditions of some uses of the natural
language particles “not”, “or”, and
“and” (another use of the particle “or” is
arguably approximated by \(f_2^7\)). Thus if we associate these
functions with the three connectives labeled earlier \(\neg\),
\(\vee\), and \(\wedge\), we could compute the truth value of complex
formulas such as \(\neg\rA\vee\neg(\rB\wedge\rC)\) given different
possible assignments of truth values to the sentence letters A, B, and
C, according to the composition of functions indicated in the
formula’s propositional structure. One can check that this
formula takes the value
F
precisely when each of A,
B, and C is assigned
T
and takes the value
T
otherwise. Under this interpretation, one can
define
A is a
classical propositional validity
if it
evaluates as
T
on every possible assignment of values
to its atomic propositional variables;
A is
classically satisfiable
if it evaluates as
T
on at least one possible assignment of values to
its atomic propositional variables (and is
classically
unsatisfiable
otherwise);
A is a
classical propositional consequence
of B if on
no assignment of values to the atoms that occur in A and B on which B,
evaluates as
T
does A evaluate as
F
;
A is a
classical propositional equivalent
of B if A
and B evaluate as
T
on precisely the same assignments
of values to atoms.
In this way, the language of propositional logic restricted to the
connectives \(\neg\), \(\vee\), and \(\wedge\) corresponds with the
formulas of the familiar two element Boolean algebra of
complementation, union, and intersection. The familiar Boolean laws
of
interchange
:
If A and B are equivalent, and A occurs as a subformula of \(\rC_1\),
then the result of replacing an occurrence of A in \(\rC_1\) with B is
a formula \(\rC_2\) that is equivalent to \(\rC_1\).
substitution
:
If A and \(\rB_1\) and \(\rC_1\) are any formulas whatsoever, then the
result of replacing
each
occurrence of the propositional
variable \(p\) in \(\rB_1\) and \(\rC_1\) with A are formulas
\(\rB_2\) and \(\rC_2\) with the properties: \(\rB_2\) is valid if
\(\rB_1\) is; \(\rB_2\) is unsatisfiable if \(\rB_1\) is; \(\rB_2\) is
a consequence of \(\rC_2\) if \(\rB_1\) is a consequence of \(\rC_1\);
\(\rB_2\) and \(\rC_2\) are equivalent if \(\rB_1\) and \(\rC_1\)
are.
complementation
:
\(\rA\vee\neg\rA\) is a classical validity (called the “law of
excluded middle” (
lem
) in propositional
logic).
double complementation
:
\(\neg\neg\rA\) is equivalent to A.
commutativity
:
\(\rA\wedge\rB\) is equivalent to \(\rB\wedge\rA\), and \(\rA\vee\rB\)
is equivalent to \(\rB\vee\rA\).
associativity
:
\((\rA\wedge\rB)\wedge\rC\) is equivalent to \(\rA\wedge
(\rB\wedge\rC)\), and \((\rA\vee\rB)\vee\rC\) is equivalent to
\(\rA\vee (\rB\vee\rC)\).
distribution
:
\(\rA\vee (\rB_1\wedge\rB_2\wedge \ldots \wedge\rB_n)\) is equivalent
to \((\rA\vee\rB_1)\wedge (\rA\vee\rB_2)\wedge \ldots \wedge
(\rA\vee\rB_n)\) and
\(\rA\wedge (\rB_1\vee\rB_2\vee \ldots \vee\rB_n)\) is equivalent to
\((\rA\wedge\rB_1)\vee (\rA\wedge\rB_2)\vee \ldots \vee
(\rA\wedge\rB_n)\).
De Morgan equivalence
:
\(\neg(\rB_1\wedge\rB_2\wedge \ldots \wedge\rB_n)\) is equivalent to
\(\neg\rB_1\vee\neg\rB_2\vee \ldots \vee\neg\rB_n\) and
\(\neg(\rB_1\vee\rB_2\vee \ldots \vee\rB_n)\) is equivalent to
\(\neg\rB_1\wedge\neg\rB_2\wedge \ldots \wedge\neg\rB_n\).
therefore apply to this language of “Boolean propositional
formulas”.
2.1.1 Normal forms
Consider any other propositional connective denoted \(\star\), of any
arity, say 3, and suppose that with it too is associated an arity-3
truth function. As before let us specify this truth function by
indicating its output on each of the \(2^3\) possible input
values.

There is a simple algorithm for constructing a Boolean formula that is
equivalent to \(\star\)(A, B, C): For each row of the defining table
for \(\star\) in which the output value is
T
,
construct a conjunction of each propositional variable that is
assigned
T
and the negation of each propositional
variable that is assigned
F
in that row’s
input: in our case, \(\rA\wedge\rB\wedge\rC\) from row 1,
\(\rA\wedge\rB\wedge\neg\rC\) from row 2, and
\(\neg\rA\wedge\rB\wedge\neg\rC\) from row 3. Then disjoin these
conjunctions. In our case the final formula is
\[(\rA\wedge \rB\wedge\rC)\vee (\rA\wedge\rB\wedge\neg\rC)\vee (\neg \rA\wedge \rB\wedge\neg\rC).\]
It is clear that this formula will evaluate as
T
on
all the rows that \(\star\)(A, B, C) did and as false on all the other
rows. Suppose, now, that one is given a propositional formula with any
arbitrary composition of connectives, and that under the classical
interpretation these connectives are associated with truth-functional
connectives of the appropriate arity. This formula will be equivalent
to some simple formula with a single connective whose arity is equal
to the total number of propositional variables in the original
formula. By the construction just rehearsed, that simple formula is
again equivalent to a Boolean formula of a certain form. Thus we have
verified the Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) theorem:
Theorem 1
.
Any formula of propositional logic
under the classical interpretation is equivalent to a disjunction of
conjunctions of propositional variables and negated propositional
variables.
Similar reasoning can be used to verify equivalence to a
“conjunctive normal formula”, a conjunction of
disjunctions of propositional variables and negated propositional
variables.
2.1.2 Truth-functional completeness
One corollary of the DNF theorem is that Boolean logic—the
fragment of propositional logic with only the connectives \(\neg\),
\(\wedge\), and \(\vee\)—is in a sense just as expressive as
full classical propositional logic with infinitely many connectives of
infinitely many arities. This fact is often expressed by saying that
the set of connectives \(\{\neg, \wedge, \vee\}\) on the classical
interpretation is “truth-functionally complete”: the other
connectives aren’t all exactly impostors in the above used
sense, but they can each be viewed as an abbreviation of some
combination of Boolean connectives. Algebraically, one can think of
the infinite function space as being fully spanned by the Boolean
functions.
The idea of truth-functional completeness can be pressed further with
the simple observation that \(\rA\wedge\rB\) is the classical
equivalent of \(\neg (\neg\rA\vee\neg\rB)\), so that it too can be
viewed as an abbreviation. So the pair \(\{\vee, \neg\}\) is
truth-functionally complete. Likewise, \(\rA\vee\rB\) abbreviates
\(\neg (\neg\rA\wedge\neg\rB)\): \(\{\wedge, \neg\}\) is
truth-functionally complete. In 1913, Henry Sheffer rediscovered an
unpublished observation of Charles Sanders Peirce that the functions
\(f_9^2\) and \(f_{15}^2\) approximating the truth conditions of the
natural language expressions “not both …and
…” and “neither …nor …” each
individually span the entire space of bivalent truth-functions.
2.1.3 Realization in switching circuits
More productive than reducing the number of connectives to the
smallest possible truth-functionally complete set, though, has been
the selection of connectives that convey the greatest perspicuity into
the structure of deductive inference. We have already indicated that
the Boolean connectives, by closely approximating the truth conditions
of the ordinary language particles “not”,
“and”, and “or”, provide a formal mechanism
for evaluating contentful human inference. Another merit of the
Boolean selection is its natural realization in the description of
relay and switching circuits. In 1940 Claude Shannon described an
interpretation of propositional logic in which sentence letters stand
for circuits: atomic circuits are nodes \(n_1\) and \(n_2\) connected
by a gated path which, when closed, allows a current to pass between
\(n_1\) to \(n_2\) and, when open, does not. \(\rA\wedge\rB\)
represents the serial connection of circuits A and B, \(\rA\vee\rB\)
represents their parallel connection, and \(\neg\rA\) represents a
circuit that is closed if A is open and open if A is closed (this is a
theoretical posit: the interpretation alone provides no predetermined
way to construct such a circuit). Letting the value 0 represent a
circuit being closed and the value 1 represent a circuit being open,
one sees that the formulas of propositional logic represent all the
possible ways of constructing electrical circuits, and their classical
truth functional analysis determines exactly whether a circuit so
represented is open: open circuits evaluate as
T
,
closed circuits as
F
.
Because of the simplicity of classical propositional logic,
Shannon’s thesis greatly facilitated circuit design.
Immediately, one sees that any circuit is equivalent to (i.e., opens
and closes under the same conditions as) a circuit described by a
disjunctive normal formula. Thus one could be given complex circuits
A, B, and C, connect A and B in series (\(\rA\vee\rB\)), then connect
this in parallel to C (\((\rA\vee\rB)\wedge\rC\)), and finally desire
a circuit that is closed when this is open: \(\neg
((\rA\vee\rB)\wedge\rC)\). This formula describes the conditions under
which the circuit you are after will be closed, but it does not
specify a way of constructing it. The DNF theorem tells us that there
is a “normal” circuit with the same closure conditions.
Because all switches in such normal circuits apply at the atomic
level, there is a known way to construct them. More, there are
systematic methods for simplifying disjunctive normal formulas to
equivalent formulas with the fewest number of occurrences of atoms
(Quine 1955 presents an algorithm originally discovered by Samson and
Mills 1954). Combined with Shannon’s result, this shows not only
that symbolic manipulation provides a guide for how to construct a
circuit with desired closure conditions but that it can be used to
design the least complicated and resource demanding one.
2.1.4 The material conditional
Another important feature of the classical interpretation is the
special role played by the binary truth function \(f_5^2\), which
always returns the value
T
unless given the input
\(\langle\)
T
,
F
\(\rangle\). This
truth function is often described, controversially, as giving the
truth conditions for the indicative mood conditional connective
“if …, then …”, or even, erroneously, for
the relation “implies”. It is important to underscore the
error in attributing truth functionality to the implication relation.
To say that one proposition implies another is to say that under any
conditions in which the first is true, the second is also true. To
suggest that this relation is truth-functional is to suggest that
simply knowing whether A and B are true is enough to determine whether
A implies B. This suggestion is untenable because the truth or falsity
of A and B indicate nothing about other conditions. B could be true
but, for all that, not be implied by A because under some other
situation A could be true while B is false. As emphasized above, the
implication relation is not ordinarily thought of as a propositional
connective at all, but a relation that two propositions might bear to
one another.
What is more interesting is the thesis that \(f_5^2\) captures the
truth conditions of, at least some uses of, conditional expressions in
the indicative mood. The binary connective given this truth-functional
interpretation is known as the “material conditional” and
is often denoted \(\supset\). One can readily check that
\(\rA\supset\rB\) is equivalent to the Boolean expression
\(\neg\rA\vee\rB\). There is a vast literature about the tenability of
the claim that ordinary language conditional expressions are
truth-functional. The claim itself is apparently ancient, attributed
to Philo of Melaga and referenced in Chrysippus’s early
systematization of propositional logic. It has been defended in a
modern context by Charles Peirce, H. P. Grice, and Frank Jackson. But
its detractors have been many (see the entry on
indicative conditionals
).
Of special interest is the suggestion, originally due to Frank Ramsey,
that expressions of the form “If A, then B” in the
indicative mood are best understood in terms of conditional
probabilities as “The probability of B given A is nearly certain
(\(\bP_\rA (\rB) > 0.95\))”. In 1976 David Lewis proved that
the conditional expressions, so understood, not only fail to be
truth-functional but in fact are not even propositions. Dorothy
Edgington (1995: 280) provided the following simple argument for
Lewis’s result: Suppose \(\bP_\rA (\rB)\) measured the
probability of some (not necessarily truth functional) proposition
\(\rA\cdot\rB\). If \(\rA\supset\rB\) implies \(\rA\cdot\rB\), then
\(\rA\cdot\rB\) is true whenever A is false. Therefore,
\(\rA\cdot\rB\) cannot be unlikely when A is unlikely. But the
unlikelihood of A certainly does not prevent \(\bP_\rA (\rB)\) from
being very low. If, on the other hand, \(\rA\supset\rB\) does not
imply \(\rA\cdot\rB\), then \(\rA\cdot\rB\) could be false when
\(\neg(\rA\wedge\neg \rB)\) is true, and certainty about
\(\neg(\rA\wedge\neg \rB)\) would still leave room for doubt about
\(\rA\cdot\rB\). But being certain of \(\neg(\rA\wedge\neg\rB)\)
suffices for \(\bP_A (\rB)=1\). It follows that \(\rA\supset\rB\)
neither implies nor doesn’t imply \(\rA\cdot\rB\), and the only
way this could happen is for \(\rA\cdot\rB\) not to have
truth-conditions at all, for \(\bP_\rA (\rB)\) not to measure the
probability of any proposition.
This example highlights again the delicacy of the problem of
determining which connectives can be analyzed under the purview of
propositional logic. On some interpretations (including the
truth-functional one), indicative mood conditionals can be, but on
Ramsey’s interpretation they cannot. In 1982, W. V. O. Quine
anticipated Lewis’s result by expressing the caution, which he
attributed to Philip Rhinelander, not to confuse the statement of a
conditional “If A, then B” with the statement of B on
condition A. The latter, he held, is typically the proper way of
understanding an expression of the form “If A, then B”,
which, because it is a non-statement in the absence of the condition
A, cannot be understood as a proposition at all.
Gottlob Frege is often counted among the defenders of the material
conditional, but his attitude towards the connective is nuanced. His
systematization of propositional logic did feature a connective with
the truth conditions given by \(f_5^2\), but Frege rejected the idea
that this connective expressed the indicative conditional of natural
language. He wrote, “the causal connection implicit in the word
‘if’ …is not expressed by our symbols” (1972:
116). It is a matter of ongoing debate whether Frege believed that the
material conditional failed even to capture the truth conditions of
ordinary language indicative conditionals or if he meant only that
although it captures those conditionals’ truth conditions, the
material conditional fails to capture other, non truth-conditional
aspects of meaning. What is clear is that whatever mismatch he
detected between ordinary conditional statements and the material
conditional did not dissuade him from placing the latter in the center
of his logical investigations.
Given the plurality of truth-functionally complete sets of
connectives, why would Frege or anyone else select the material
conditional as a primitive connective for classical logic? Frege saw
that the value of selecting the material conditional as a primitive
connective not from its approximation of ordinary language expression
but from its role internal to logical theory. Let us write
\(\dturnstile{\CTT} \rB\) to indicate that the formula B is valid in
the classical theory of truth. Generalizing this turnstile notation,
one also writes \(\rA \dturnstile{\CTT} \rB\) to indicate that B is a
classical propositional consequence of A, and where \(\calS\) is a set
of propositional formulas, \(\calS \dturnstile{\CTT} \rB\) to indicate
that B is a classical propositional consequence of all the formulas in
\(\calS\). A fundamental fact, readily verifiable with a truth table,
is that \(\calS\cup\{\rA\}\dturnstile{\CTT} \rB\) if, and only if,
\(\calS\dturnstile{\CTT} \rA\supset\rB\). In the case that \(\calS\)
is empty, \(\rA\dturnstile{\CTT} \rB\) exactly when
\(\dturnstile{\CTT} \rA\supset\rB\). Earlier we emphasized that the
material conditional cannot be understood as an expression of logical
implication. The relation of classical logical consequence, on the
other hand, is in fact a (particularly strict sort of) logical
implication relation, one to which the material conditional is in fact
directly related: \(\rA\supset\rB\) does not express any implication
relation between A and B, but the claim that \(\rA\supset\rB\) is a
classical propositional validity is such an expression of
implication.
2.1.5 Decidability
A logic is said to be decidable if there is a reliable method for
determining whether a formula is satisfiable. Classical propositional
logic is readily seen to be decidable: Given an arbitrary formula,
simply enumerate in the tabular method used above each of the possible
sequences of truth values that can be input to its atomic
propositional variables, and compute the composition of functions on
each of these inputs. Because formulas are finite strings of symbols,
each contains only a finite number, say
n
, of atoms, so that
the truth-table will have exactly \(2^n\) rows. Completing the truth
table is therefore a finite determinate task, at the end of which one
will have discovered whether or not the formula is satisfiable.
2.1.6 NP-completeness
The problem of determining whether a formula of classical
propositional logic is satisfiable is known as
sat
.
Although decision procedures exists for
sat
,
all known procedures for making this
determination in a predetermined manner for every possible formula are
in a precise sense tedious and inefficient: no procedure has been
discovered which returns an answer after a number of computation steps
polynomially bounded by the size of the formula one tests, i.e., it is
unknown whether
sat
is in the complexity class
P
of problems solvable by a deterministic procedure
in polynomial time. It is known that
sat
is in
the complexity class
NP
—those questions that
can be answered by a non-deterministic procedure in polynomial time.
In 1971, Steven Cook proved that
sat
is
“
NP
-complete”: any problem in the class
NP
is reducible in polynomial time to
sat
.
A corollary of Cook’s theorem is that if
sat
is in the class
P
, then
NP
=
P
. It is generally believed
that
NP
is a strictly larger class of problems than
P
and, for this reason, that no
“efficient” procedure for solving
sat
in the sense of polynomial time computability
exists. In the decades since Cook’s discovery, a wide range of
problems have been shown to be
NP
-complete. But
classical propositional logic figured prominently in the context of
the discovery of
NP
-completeness. Its perspicuity was
particularly suited to stage the concept’s formation.
2.1.7 Compactness
A fundamental fact about classical propositional logic is that it is
“compact”. To motivate the idea of compactness, consider
the set of formulas \(\calS = \{p_1, p_2, p_3, \neg (p_1\wedge
p_2\wedge p_3) \}\). Every proper subset of \(\calS\) is
“simultaneously satisfiable”, i.e., given any such proper
subset, there is a single assignment of truth values to atoms under
which each of the subset’s formulas are true. However, \(\calS\)
itself is not simultaneously satisfiable: Making each of \(p_1\),
\(p_2\), and \(p_3\) true guarantees the falsity of \(\neg (p_1\wedge
p_2\wedge p_3)\). What if another set \(\calT\) contains infinitely
many formulas? Our observation about \(\calS\) might well foster the
intuition that every proper subset of \(\calT\) could be
simultaneously satisfiable despite there being no assignment of truth
values to atoms that satisfies every formula in \(\calT\). What if,
instead of knowing that every
proper
subset of \(\calT\) is
simultaneously satisfiable, one were told only that each
finite
subset of \(\calT\) is? Because most proper subsets of
\(\calT\) are infinite, the intuition that \(\calT\) could
nevertheless fail to be simultaneously satisfiable is only
strengthened.
The Compactness Theorem (Gödel 1930) tells us that this intuition
is misleading:
Theorem 2
.
If each finite subset of \(\calT\) is
simultaneously satisfiable, then so is \(\calT\).
Notice that by “relaxing” the hypothesis from
“proper subset” to “finite subset”, the
Compactness Theorem is true and in fact trivial when \(\calT\) is
finite: \(\calT\) is one of its own finite subsets. When \(\calT\) is
infinite, though, relaxing the hypothesis dramatically increases the
theorem’s strength (In the language of quantification theory,
the theorem involves a strong quantifier switch: From the fact that,
given any finite subset of \(\calT\), one can always find an
interpretation that satisfies it (potentially a different
interpretation for each finite subset), one may infer the existence of
a single interpretation that satisfies every possible finite subset of
\(\calT\) one might ever be given).
For a striking corollary of compactness, suppose that A is the
classical propositional consequence of the infinite set of formulas
\(\calU\) (\(\calU \dturnstile{\CTT} \rA\)). If every finite subset of
\(\calU\cup\{\neg\rA\}\) were simultaneously satisfiable, then by
compactness, \(\calU\cup \{\neg\rA\}\) would be simultaneously
satisfiable, contrary to the our supposition. Therefore, some finite
subset of \(\calU\cup\{\neg\rA\}\) is not simultaneously
satisfiable—for some finite subset \(\calV\) of \(\calU\), there
is no assignment of truth values to atoms that makes every formula in
\(\calV\) true and A false. Classical propositional consequence is
always “finitely determined”: If \(\calU \dturnstile{\CTT}
\rA\), then for some finite subset \(\calV\) of \(\calU\), \(\calV
\dturnstile{\CTT} \rA\).
2.2 Deduction
Formal deduction systems, introduced by Gottlob Frege in 1879, provide
an alternative specification of the meanings of propositional
connectives. Such systems are characterized by a finite set of
formulas called axioms and a finite set of inference rules. The
propositional axioms in Frege’s system are
\[
\begin{align}
\rA&\supset (\rB\supset\rA) \tag*{axiom 1}\\
(\rC\supset (\rB\supset\rA))&\supset ((\rC\supset\rB)\supset (\rC\supset\rA))  \tag*{axiom 2}\\
(\rB\supset\rA)&\supset (\neg\rA\supset \neg\rB) \tag*{axiom 3}\\
\rA&\supset \neg\neg\rA \tag*{axiom 4}\\
\neg\neg\rA&\supset\rA \tag*{axiom 5}\\
\end{align}
\]
The inference rules of are
modus ponens
: \(\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{\(\rA\supset\rB\)}\AxiomC{\(\rA\)}\BinaryInfC{\(\rB\)}
\end{prooftree}\)
substitution: If \(p\) is an atomic variable in B, and C is any
formula whatsoever, then let \(\rB'\) be the result of replacing every
occurrence of \(p\) with C, and from B infer \(\rB'\).
A proof is defined as a finite sequence of formulas, each one of which
either is an axiom or follows from previous entries in the sequence by
an application of an inference rule. A theorem is a formula which
occurs as the final entry in a proof, and we denote the theoremhood of
a formula A by \(\turnstile{\CPC} \rA\)—here
cpc
stands for “the classical propositional
calculus”. We have presented the formal deduction system found
in Frege 1879, but
cpc
is meant to label any
equivalent system. Frege’s system is in two senses adequate for
representing classical propositional logic: Because the pair \(\{\neg,
\supset\}\) is truth-functionally complete, any formula expressible
with any combination of bivalent truth-functional connectives
whatsoever can be translated into a formula in Frege’s system.
Moreover, the system is complete in the sense that all and only the
classical propositional tautologies are theorems. The verification of
this propositional completeness theorem below uses a different
deductive system for
cpc
due to Hilbert and
Bernays. As Jean Nicod (1917) was the first to observe, there are even
presentations of
cpc
using only the single
“not both …and …” connective \(|\), e.g.,
with the lone axiom
\[((\rA | (\rB | \rC)) | ((\rE | (\rE | \rE)) | ((\rD | \rB) | ((\rA | \rD) | (\rA | \rD)))))\]
and rules of inference
Nicod’s inference
: \(\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{\(\rA\)} \AxiomC{\(\rA|(\rB|\rC)\)} \BinaryInfC{\(\rC\)}
\end{prooftree}\)
substitution: If \(p\) is an atomic variable in B, and C is any
formula whatsoever, then let B’ be the result of replacing every
occurrence of \(p\) with C, and from B infer B’.
In parallel to the truth-functional framework for classical logic, one
can also introduce the notion of deduction from hypotheses: If
\(\calS\) is a set of formulas, then a sequence of formulas whose last
entry is A and in which every entry either is an axiom, a member of
\(\calS\), or the result of an application of a inference rule from
earlier entries is called a derivation of A from \(\calS\). In
formulating this notion for
cpc
, however, some
care is needed. One does not want, for example, every formula to be
deducible from a propositional variable, and yet the substitution rule
allows one to infer anything from \(p_1\). In moving from pure
axiomatic provability to the idea of deduction from arbitrary
hypotheses, therefore, the substitution rule is restricted to be
applicable only to axioms. One can easily show that this restriction
does not affect the set of theorems. With this restriction in place,
we can denote the derivability of A from the set \(\calS\) by \(\calS
\turnstile{\CPC} \rA\).
2.2.1 The Deduction Theorem
In 1910 Frege pointed out, but did not prove, that
\(\calS\cup\{\rA\}\turnstile{\CPC} \rB\) if, and only if,
\(\calS\turnstile{\CPC} \rA\supset\rB\). The first recorded proofs are
in Herbrand 1930 and Tarski 1933. Whereas the analogous observation in
the case of the truth-functional interpretation is trivial, this
result of Herbrand and Tarski is more complex. One direction is
readily verified: Any \(\calS\)-derivation \(\calD\) of
\(\rA\supset\rB\) is obviously also a \(\calS\cup\{\rA\}\)-derivation.
To construct a \(\calS\cup\{\rA\}\)-derivation of \(\rB\), simply
append the two formulas \(\rA\) and \(\rB\) to the end of
\(\calD\).
The other direction is known as the Deduction Theorem. It’s
proof uses induction on the length of the \(\calS\cup\{
\rA\}\)-derivation of \(\rB\):
Theorem 3
.
\(\calS\cup\{
\rA\}\turnstile{\CPC}\rB\) only if \(\calS
\turnstile{\CPC}\rA\supset\rB\)
Proof.
(
base step
) If there is a
one-line derivation of \(\rB\) from \(\calS\cup\{ \rA\}\), then it is
possible to construct a \(\calS\)-derivation of \(\rA\supset\rB\). To
see this, notice that there are only three types of one-line
derivations:
\(\rB\) is in the set \(\calS\)
\(\rB\) is \(\rA\)
\(\rB\) is an axiom
The following three \(\calS\)-derivations exhibit the fact that
\(\calS \turnstile{\CPC}\rA\supset\rB\) in case 1, 2, and 3,
respectively:
\[\begin{array}{c|c|c}

\rB & (\rB\supset
((\rC\supset\rB)\supset\rB))\supset
((\rB\supset
(\rC\supset\rB))\supset(\rB\supset\rB)) &
\rB \\

\rB\supset (\rA\supset\rB) & \rB\supset
((\rC\supset\rB)\supset\rB) & \rB\supset
(\rA\supset\rB) \\

\rA\supset\rB & (\rB\supset
(\rC\supset\rB))\supset(\rB\supset\rB)) &
\rA\supset\rB \\

& \rB\supset (\rC\supset\rB) & \\

& \rB\supset\rB &

  
\end{array}\]
It is easy to check that each line of each derivation is either a
member of \(\calS,\) an axiom, or the results of an application of
modus ponens
. (The middle sequence qualifies as a
\(\calS\)-derivation of \(\rA\supset\rB\) because of the assumption
that \(\rA\) is \(\rB\).)
(
induction step
) Assume that whenever there is
a \(\calS\cup\{ \rA\}\)-derivation of \(\rB\) that is
n
or
fewer lines long, there is a \(\calS\)-derivation of
\(\rA\supset\rB\). Now suppose there is an \(n+1\) line long
\(\calS\cup\{ \rA\}\)-derivation \(\calD\) of \(\rB\). It is possible
that the justification for line \(n+1\) is one of the possibilities
from the base case—that \(\rB\) is an axiom, is from the set
\(\Gamma\), or is identical to \(\rA\). In any of those cases, the
\(\calS\)-derivation of \(\rA\supset\rB\) would be constructed as in
the base case. In the novel case that the last line is the result of
an application of
modus ponens
, the formulas
\(\rC\supset\rB\) and \(\rC\) occur as earlier lines in \(\calD\).
Therefore \(\calS\cup\{ \rA\}\)-derivations that are
n
lines
long or shorter of \(\rC\supset\rB\) and \(\rC\) appear as
subsequences of \(\calD\). The induction hypothesis then guarantees
the existence of \(\calS\)-derivations of \(\rA\supset
(\rC\supset\rB)\) and of \(\rA\supset\rC\). Let
\[\calD_1 = \langle\rS_1, \rS_2, \ldots, \rA\supset (\rC\supset\rB)\rangle\]
and
\[\calD_2 = \langle\rT_1, \rT_2, \ldots, \rA\supset\rC\rangle\]
be examples of such derivations, and consider the sequence:
\[\begin{array}{c}

  \calD_1\\
  \calD_2\\
  (\rA\supset (\rC\supset\rB))\supset
  ((\rA\supset\rC)\supset
  (\rA\supset\rB))\\
  (\rA\supset\rC)\supset
  (\rA\supset\rB)\\
  \rA\supset\rB

\end{array}\]
This is a \(\calS\)-derivation of \(\rA\supset\rB\). ◻
Because this verification of the Deduction Theorem depends only on the
first two of Frege’s axioms, it applies also in many
non-classical contexts including, importantly, a large class of
constructive propositional logics.
2.2.2 Basic meta-theory
Another analogue to the evident facts from the truth-functional
framework, this time the DNF theorem, played a historical role in the
metatheoretical analysis of axiomatic systems. Hilbert showed how to
associate with every formula A a disjunctive normal formula
\(\rA_{\dnf}\) and a conjunctive normal formula \(\rA_{\cnf}\) such
that
\[\begin{aligned}
&\turnstile{\CPC} \rA \supset\rA_{\dnf},\\ 
&\turnstile{\CPC} \rA_{\dnf} \supset\rA, \\
&\turnstile{\CPC} \rA \supset\rA_{\cnf}, \text{ and }\\ 
&\turnstile{\CPC} \rA_{\cnf} \supset\rA.
\end{aligned}
\]
In particular, applying the Deduction Theorem, A and \(\rA_{\cnf}\)
are inter-derivable.
Frege’s axiomatization obviously depends on the expressive
adequacy of the pair \(\{\supset, \neg\}\), about which one cannot
really be certain unless one has in mind some account of the meaning
of the connectives other than that provided by the deduction system
itself. Russell and Whitehead in
Principia Mathematica
and
Hilbert and Ackermann in 1928 followed Frege in working with a small
set of basic connectives and using others as abbreviations. In 1926,
Bernays questioned “the predominant tendency …to reduce
the number of basic connectives and therewith the number of
axioms”, observing that “one can, on the other hand,
sharply distinguish the various connectives” and thereby not
presuppose equivalences such as \(\neg\rA\vee\rB = \rA\supset\rB\)
that do not appear in the axiomatic framework itself. Such an approach
allows one to explore modifications of an axiom system in which
certain equivalences do not hold, and to compare them with one
another. The axiomatic framework is generally a crude device for such
comparative studies; the spirit of Bernays’s insight reached its
maturation in the natural deduction and sequent calculi of Gentzen
(1934–35) wherein the meaning of each connective is fully
specified, in terms of characterizing inference rules, in isolation of
the other connectives.
The axiomatic framework with minimal signature (following Russell and
Whitehead, Hilbert used only \(\{\vee, \neg\}\)) nevertheless
submitted to the Hilbert school’s profound metatheoretical
analysis in terms of consistency, independence, maximality, and
completeness proofs. In order to preserve the context of discovery,
the following retraces the original proofs provided in Hilbert’s
lectures “Prinzipien der Mathematik” from 1917.
2.2.2.1 Consistency
An formal deductive system
S
is
consistent
if for no formula A is \(\turnstile{\rS} \rA\) and
\(\turnstile{\rS} \neg\rA\). To prove consistency of
cpc
,
Hilbert reasoned as follows: Let the sentence
letters range over the numbers 1 and 0, interpret the disjunction
symbol as multiplication and the negation symbol as the function \(1 -
x\). In this interpretation, every formula is a function on 0 and 1
composed of multiplication and \(1 - x\). Hilbert observed that the
axioms are each interpreted as functions that return the value 0 on
every input, and that the rules of inference each preserve this
property (so that every theorem is constant 0). Furthermore, the
negation of any theorem is constant 1 and therefore unprovable. Thus,
no formula is provable if its negation also is, so the system is
consistent.
2.2.2.2 Maximality
A formal deductive system is
maximal
if any proper extension
of it is inconsistent. Hilbert used the same interpretation from his
consistency argument to show:
Theorem 4
.
cpc
is
maximal.
Proof.
As above, a formula is provable only if it is constant
0 under the interpretation, which, in the case of a conjunctive normal
formula, occurs precisely when each of its conjuncts contains both a
negated and unnegated occurrence of some propositional variable. Now
let A be any unprovable formula. Its associated formula \(\rA_{\cnf}\)
must also be unprovable and therefore must contain a conjunct C with
no propositional variable appearing both negated and unnegated. To
show that
cpc
+A (
cpc
augmented with A as an additional axiom) is inconsistent, let B be any
formula whatsoever, and label D the result of substituting, into
\(\rA_{\cnf}\), B for every propositional variable that occurs
unnegated in C and \(\neg\rB\) for every propositional variable that
occurs negated in C. It is easy to show that
\[\begin{aligned}
&\turnstile{\CPC+\rA} \rA, \\
&\turnstile{\CPC} \rA\supset\rA_{\cnf},\\
&\turnstile{\CPC} \rA_{\cnf}\supset\rD, \text{ and}\\
&\turnstile{\CPC} \rD\supset\rB.\\
\end{aligned}
\]
Thus \(\turnstile{\CPC+\rA} \rB\) for any formula B. ◻
Hilbert and others called this same property
“completeness”, in analogy to the completeness axiom from
Hilbert’s foundational studies of plane geometry and number
theory. But as completeness has come to mean something else in the
logical domain, this property is now commonly referred to as
“Post-completeness” (after Post 1921 who rediscovered this
property of
cpc
) or, as here, as
“maximality”.
2.2.2.3 Completeness
The Completeness Theorem describes an exact correspondence between the
truth-functional and deductive frameworks:
Theorem 5
.
\(\turnstile{\CPC} \rA\) if, and only
if, \(\dturnstile{\CTT} \rA\).
Proof.
This result is often described as difficult to
establish, but in Hilbert’s 1917 lectures, it is an immediate
corollary of maximality. Already it was observed in the consistency
argument that only formulas interpreted as constant 0 functions are
provable. Suppose that some formula A were constant 0 but unprovable
in
cpc
. Then the same consistency argument as
before would carry through for
cpc
+A,
contradicting the maximality result just proved. It follows that every
formula interpreted as a constant 0 function is a theorem of
cpc
.
The formulas interpreted as constant 0
functions are just the valid formulas on the classical
truth-functional interpretation. ◻
A direct route to the Completeness Theorem is also possible. A famous
proof from Kalmár 1935 begins with two observations:
K1
\(\turnstile{\CPC} (\rA\supset \rB)\supset ((\neg \rA\supset
\rB)\supset \rB)\)
K2
Let A be any formula with propositional variables \(p_1\),
\(p_2\), …, \(p_n\), and let \(\mathit{v}\) be an assignment of
truth values to propositional variables. Define \(\rC_k = p_1\) if
\(\mathit{v}(p_1) = \mathbf{T}\), \(\neg p_1\) if \(\mathit{v}(p_k) =
\mathbf{F}\). Then if \(\mathit{v}(\rB) = \mathbf{T}\), \(\rC_1,
\rC_2, \ldots, \rC_n \turnstile{\CPC} \rB\).
Proof.
Suppose now that T is a classical validity with
propositional variables \(p_1\), \(p_2\), …, \(p_n\). Then by
K2
,
 for every assignment \(\mathit{v}\) of truth values to propositional
variables, \(\mathit{v}(\rT) = \mathbf{T}\) and \(\rC_1, \rC_2,
\ldots, \rC_n \turnstile{\CPC} \rT\). Let \(\mathit{u}\) and
\(\mathit{w}\) be assignments of truth values that differ only in that
\(\mathit{u}(p_n) = \mathbf{T}\) whereas \(\mathit{w}(p_n) =
\mathbf{F}.\)
\[\rC_1, \rC_2, \ldots, \rC_{n-1}, p_n \turnstile{\CPC} \rT\]
and
\[\rC_1, \rC_2, \ldots, \rC_{n-1}, \neg p_n \turnstile{\CPC} \rT.\]
By the Deduction Theorem,
\[\rC_1, \rC_2, \ldots, \rC_{n-1} \turnstile{\CPC} p_n\supset \rT,\]
and
\[\rC_1, \rC_2, \ldots, \rC_{n-1} \turnstile{\CPC} \neg p_n\supset \rT.\]
By
K1
,
\[\rC_1, \rC_2, \ldots, \rC_{n-1} \turnstile{\CPC} (p_n\supset \rT)\supset ((\neg p_n\supset \rT)\supset \rT).\]
Two applications of
modus ponens
yield
\[\rC_1, \rC_2, \ldots, \rC_{n-1} \turnstile{\CPC} \rT.\]
Repeating this same reasoning for \(p_{n-1}\) yields
\[\rC_1, \rC_2, \ldots, \rC_{n-2} \turnstile{\CPC} \rT,\]
and after
n
repetitions \(\turnstile{\CPC} \rT\) is
established. ◻
Proving completeness directly in this manner allows a different
argument for maximality:
Proof.
For suppose \(\centernot{\turnstile{\CPC}} \rA\). Then
by completeness, \(\centernot{\dturnstile{\CTT}} \rA\). So there is
some assignment \(\mathit{v}\) of truth values to propositional
variables on which A evaluates as
F
. Let \(\rA'\) be
the result of replacing every propositional variable assigned
T
by \(\mathit{v}\) with \(p_1\supset p_1\) and every
propositional variable assigned
F
by \(\mathit{v}\)
with \(p_1\supset\neg p_1\). \(\rA'\) is unsatisfiable. Therefore
\(\neg \rA'\) is valid. So \(\turnstile{\CPC+\rA} \neg\rA'\). But
\(\turnstile{\CPC+\rA} \rA\) and, by substitution,
\(\turnstile{\CPC+\rA} \rA'\). So
cpc
+A is
inconsistent. ◻
2.2.2.4 Completeness as semi-decidability
The set of theorems of a formal deductive system can be seen to be
recursively enumerable. To construct a simple enumeration, let us add
to the language of propositional logic the symbol “;” as a
sequential location demarcator so that the language consists of \(p_1,
p_2, \ldots, (, ), \supset, \neg, \hbox{and} ;\). Then we can list all
possible sequences of symbols in stages:
Stage 1: list all strings of symbols of length 1 using only the
propositional variable \(p_1\).
Stage 2: list all strings of symbols of length 1 or 2 using only
propositional variables \(p_1\) and \(p_2\).
...
At each stage, the vocabulary is finite, so there are only finitely
many strings of symbols to list. But every proof is a finite string of
symbols and therefore gets listed at some stage or another. Therefore,
given a formula A, one can begin searching for a proof one stage at a
time, checking only finitely many strings at each stage. If A is
valid, then by completeness it is provable, and one will discover a
proof of it after examining some finite number of strings. On the
other hand, if A is not valid, the search will never halt.
Completeness results are often described as valuable because they make
evident the recursive enumerability of a logic’s validities. In
the case of classical propositional logic, validity is already known
to be recursively enumerable and even decidable by a much simpler and
more efficient method of truth table evaluation. The Completeness
Theorem’s value derives instead from the fact that two vastly
different conceptions of logicality—formal provability and
truth-functional validity—coincide. The situation is different
with other logical systems. The most famous example is first-order
classical quantification theory, which Church and Turing proved to be
undecidable in 1936. Here, the Completeness Theorem of Gödel 1930
is especially insightful: the set of quantificational validities is
not recursive, but it is at least recursively enumerable. In fact, the
completeness results for classical propositional logic and
quantification theory were the historical occasion for the
clarification of the distinction between recursive and recursively
enumerable sets—a distinction seen as elementary today but the
source of considerable confusion in the first decades of the twentieth
century.
Completeness results can play a role for many alternative systems of
propositional logic similar to the one they play for classical
quantification theory: Urquhart 1984 showed that the systems
e
and
r
of relevance logic
are undecidable; Lincoln et al. 1992 showed that full propositional
linear logic
ll
is undecidable. In these
arenas, a complete formal derivation system can provide some concrete
access to the space of valid formulas whose abstract definition is not
otherwise readily navigable.
2.2.2.5 Independence
The style of reasoning exhibited in the consistency argument can be
generalized to show independence results. The idea of the consistency
argument was first to describe a property P such that
all the axioms have P, and
if an inference rule is applied to a formula with P, then the formula
that results from its application also has P
and then to show that certain formulas do not have P. Because all
theorems either are axioms or are generated from axioms by iterated
applications of inference rules, those latter formulas cannot be
theorems.
In the consistency proof, P is the property of being interpreted as a
constant 0 function, and the formulas that do not have P are the
negations of theorems. The reasoning can be generalized, though.
Suppose P were some other property that all but one of the axioms have
and that is similarly preserved by the inference rules. By verifying
this one could show that the one axiom is not derivable from the
others and therefore that the deductive system would have fewer
theorems without it. For example, the classical interpretation of
\(\supset\) is a function that returns 1 on the input \(\langle 0,
1\rangle\) and 0 otherwise, and the classical interpretation of
\(\neg\) is the function that returns 1 on the input 0 and returns 0
on the input 1. All five of Frege’s axioms are constant 0 on
this interpretation. If we modify the interpretation so that
\(\supset\) is unchanged but \(\neg\) returns 1 on the input 1 and
returns 0 on the input 0, then
axioms 1, 2, 4, and 5
are still interpreted as constant 0 functions, whereas axiom 3
returns 1 on the input \(\langle 0, 1\rangle\). The inference rules
still preserve the property of being constant 0 on this modified
interpretation, so we know that axiom 3 cannot be proved using only
axioms 1, 2, 4, and 5 and that without axiom 3 Frege’s system
would not be complete.
For a more interesting example, consider the interpretation of
\(\supset\) and \(\neg\) in terms of trivalent functions given by the
following tables:
A
B
\(\rA\supset\rB\)
0
0
0
1
0
0
2
0
0
0
1
1
1
1
0
2
1
0
0
2
2
1
2
2
2
2
0
A
\(\neg\rA\)
0
2
1
2
2
0
If P is the property of being a constant 0 function on this
interpretation, then one can verify that
axioms 1, 2, 3, and 4 each have P
P is preserved by
modus ponens
and substitution
axiom 5 evaluates as 1 on the input 1 and so does not have property
P
and that axiom 5 is therefore independent of the first four
axioms.
The use of non-classical (typically higher valence) truth-functional
interpretations to define properties to be used in independence proofs
dates back to Schröder 1890. It was pursued in full generality by
Łukasiewicz, who also proved results about the scope of this
technique.
2.3 Gentzen’s calculi
In 1934–35, Gerhard Gentzen introduced two alternative
frameworks for presenting deductive inference that have led to
particularly refined analyses of propositional logic. We will look
first at Gentzen’s system of natural deduction and later
consider his sequent calculus.
2.3.1 Natural deduction
In lectures from early 1920, David Hilbert remarked that a formal
deduction system’s inference rules can be thought of as
providing the meanings of the connectives they govern (Hilbert 2013:
323). Hilbert’s idea is given a profound realization in
Gentzen’s natural deduction calculus. Natural deduction is an
early and emblematic achievement in “proof-theoretic
semantics”: the tradition of specifying definitions in
inferential, rather than denotational, terms.
In systems like
cpc
the only inference rule
responsible specifically to a connective is
modus ponens
.
What would it mean for this rule not only to describe a deductively
valid pattern of inference but in fact to provide a definition of the
connective \(\supset\)? If one understands
modus ponens
not
just as one among many patterns of valid inference but as saying that
it is
definitive
of the conditional \(\rA\supset\rB\) that it
licenses the inference from \(\rA\) to \(\rB\), then part of what one
means is that any sentence that, together with \(\rA\), allows the
inference to \(\rB\) expresses something equivalent to or stronger
than \(\rA\supset\rB\). To illustrate this, let us rewrite
modus
ponens
in the turnstile notation as
\[\begin{aligned}
\rA\supset\rB, \rA
\vdash \rB
\end{aligned}\]
Understood as a definition of \(\supset\), this determines the
following form of the Deduction Theorem, stating that
\(\rA\supset\rB\) can be inferred from any other formula that
similarly licenses the inference from A to B:
\[
\hbox{for all }\rC, \hbox{if } \rC, \rA
\vdash \rB, \hbox{then }
\rC\vdash \rA\supset\rB
\]
In Gentzen’s terminology, rules like
modus ponens
that
describe the definitive way of reasoning from a sentence governed by a
certain connective are called “elimination rules”. The
Deduction Theorem, in describing the definitive pattern of reasoning
whose conclusion is governed by a certain connective, is an example of
an “introduction rule”. Gentzen wrote:
The introductions represent …the “definitions” of
the symbols concerned, and the eliminations are no more, in the final
analysis, than the consequences of these definitions. …By
making these ideas more precise it should be possible to display the
Elim-rules as unique functions of their corresponding Intro-rules.
(1934–35: §II 5.13)
The precisification Gentzen foresaw is this: Elimination rules are not
“consequences” of their corresponding introduction rules;
neither are introduction rules “consequences” of their
corresponding elimination rules; but rules of the one type do follow
from the conception of their corresponding rules of the other type as
definitions. When conditionalization is understood as an operation
that maps \(\rA\) and \(\rB\) to the proposition that together with
\(\rA\) licenses an inference to \(\rB\),
modus ponens
captures the part about licensing this inference, and the Deduction
Theorem captures the part about being
the thing
that so
licenses it, so that any other proposition that allows an inference
from \(\rA\) to \(\rB\) only does so
via
\(\rA\supset\rB\)
(see Franks 2021).
To take another example, consider the inferences \(\rA\wedge\rB\vdash
\rA\) and \(\rA\wedge\rB\vdash \rB\). One might think of these as
definitive of the logical conjunction: To know \(\rA\wedge\rB\) is to
be in a position to immediately infer both A and B. If so, then simply
being in the position to immediately infer both A and B should suffice
to allow one to conclude \(\rA\wedge\rB\): For all \(\rC\), if
\(\rC\vdash \rA\) and \(\rC\vdash \rB\), then \(\rC\vdash
\rA\wedge\rB\). Here again, Gentzen labeled the first pair of
inferences the elimination rule for \(\wedge\) and the latter
inference its introduction rule.
Gentzen’s system of natural deduction is a presentation of logic
in terms of an intro/elim pair of rules, related as are
modus
ponens
and the Deduction theorem, providing an inferential
definition of each logical particle. His natural deduction system of
propositional logic has such pairs of rules for the propositional
connectives \(\supset\), \(\wedge\), \(\vee\), and \(\neg\), which he
presented in two-dimensional inference figures:
\[\hspace{-10em}
\begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{\(\rA\supset\rB\)} \AxiomC{\(\rA\)}
\RightLabel{\({\supset}\text{elim}\)} \BinaryInfC{\(\rB\)}
\end{prooftree}
\hspace{4em}
\begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{\([\rA]\)} \noLine\UnaryInfC{\(\vdots\)}
\noLine\UnaryInfC{\(\rB\)} \RightLabel{\({\supset}\text{intro}\)}
\UnaryInfC{\(\rA\supset\rB\)} \end{prooftree}
\]

\[\hspace{-4em}
\begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{\(\rA\wedge\rB\)} \UnaryInfC{\(\rA\)}
\end{prooftree} \quad \begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{\(\rA\wedge\rB\)}
\RightLabel{\({\wedge}\text{elim}\)} \UnaryInfC{\(\rB\)}
\end{prooftree}
\hspace{4em}
\begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{\(\rA\)} \AxiomC{\(\rB\)}
\RightLabel{\({\wedge}\text{intro}\)} \BinaryInfC{\(\rA\wedge\rB\)}
\end{prooftree}\]
 
\[\hspace{-3em}
\begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{\(\rA\vee\rB\)} \AxiomC{[\(\rA\)]}
\noLine\UnaryInfC{\(\vdots\)} \noLine\UnaryInfC{\(\rC\)}
\AxiomC{[\(\rB\)]} \noLine\UnaryInfC{\(\vdots\)}
\noLine\UnaryInfC{\(\rC\)} \RightLabel{\({\vee}\text{elim}\)}
\TrinaryInfC{\(\rC\)} \end{prooftree}
\hspace{7em}
\begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{\(\rA\)} \UnaryInfC{\(\rA\vee\rB\)}
\end{prooftree} \quad \begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{\(\rB\)}
\RightLabel{\({\vee}\text{intro}\)} \UnaryInfC{\(\rA\vee\rB\)}
\end{prooftree}\]
 
\[\hspace{-10em}
\begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{\(\neg\rA\)} \AxiomC{\(\rA\)}
\RightLabel{\({\neg}\text{elim}\)} \BinaryInfC{\(\bot\)}
\end{prooftree}
\hspace{6em}
\begin{prooftree} \AxiomC{\([\rA]\)} \noLine\UnaryInfC{\(\vdots\)}
\noLine\UnaryInfC{\(\bot\)} \RightLabel{\({\neg}\text{intro}\)}
\UnaryInfC{\(\neg A\)} \end{prooftree}\]
Notice the appearance of the arity-0 connective \(\bot\) in the
\(\neg\) rules, which has no inferential definition of its own.
Natural deduction proofs are trees constructed by iterating these
rules. When all the assumptions in such a proof are discharged by the
application of a rule, the formula in the tree’s single root
node is said to be proved; otherwise it is said to be derived from the
set of assumptions that remain open at leaf nodes. Let us write
\(\turnstile{\ND} \rA\) when there is a natural deduction proof of
A.
Gentzen observed that the natural deduction calculus with intro/elim
pairs of rules for the connectives \(\supset\), \(\wedge\), \(\vee\),
and \(\neg\) is
not
equivalent to classical propositional
logic: \(\turnstile{\ND} \rA\) only if \(\dturnstile{\CTT} \rA\), but,
for example, \(\dturnstile{\CTT} \rA\vee\neg\rA\) whereas
\(\centernot{\turnstile{\ND}} \rA\vee\neg\rA\). “The law of
excluded middle, which the intuitionists reject”, Gentzen wrote,
“occupies a special position” in natural deduction.
Gentzen’s framework revealed that the specification of the
meanings of the propositional connectives in terms of binary truth
functions does not correspond with the “inferential”
specification of their meanings in terms of the intro/elim rule
scheme. In fact, Johansson pointed out in 1937 that the introduction
and elimination rules of Gentzen’s natural deduction cannot even
derive the rule of disjunctive syllogism
\[
  \begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{\(\rA\vee\rB\)}\AxiomC{\(\neg\rB\)}\BinaryInfC{\(\rA\)}
  \end{prooftree}
\]
This elementary inference that Chrysippus famously attributed to
hunting dogs cannot be justified by the inferential meaning of the
\(\neg\) and \(\vee\) connectives alone. To derive the disjunctive
syllogism rule, one needs the additional primitive inference figure
\[
  \begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{\(\bot\)}\UnaryInfC{A}
  \end{prooftree}
\qquad(\textit{ex falso quodlibet});\]
to derive the principle of excluded middle, one needs in addition the
double negation rule
\[
  \begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{\(\neg\neg\rA\)}\UnaryInfC{\(\rA\)} 
  \end{prooftree}.
\]
These rules can be used together with the introduction and elimination
rules for the propositional connectives to construct natural deduction
systems
nd
+\(\frac{\bot}{\rA}\) for
intuitionistic propositional logic and
nd
+\(\frac{\neg\neg\rA}{\rA}\)
for classical
propositional logic, but Gentzen observed, such inference schemata
“fall outside the intro/elim framework …”.
(Classical propositional logic is often given a natural deduction
presentation
nd
+\(\frac{\bot}{\rA}\)+\(\frac{\neg\neg\rA}{\rA}\),
but the
ex falso quodlibet
rule is redundant in that system
because \(\bot \turnstile{\ND+({\neg\neg\rA}/{\rA})} \rB\).)
The distinction between classical and intuitionistic logic predates
Gentzen’s work. But with its inferential definition of
propositional connectives, natural deduction sheds new light on the
distinction: classical, intuitionist, and other logicians can agree to
the same definitions of the propositional connectives, the differences
between their conceptions of logic having to do with the acceptability
of principles like the law of excluded middle that are independent of
the connectives’ meanings.
2.3.2 Sequent calculus
This same point is brought out in a different way in Gentzen’s
propositional sequent calculi. These calculi present logical inference
in the form of sequents: expressions of the form “\(\Gamma
\Lrightarrow \Delta\)” in which Greek letters stand for
(possibly empty) finite sequences of formula. The sequences to the
left and to the right of the coordinating “sequent arrow”
\(\Lrightarrow\) are called the antecedent and succedent. The sequent
calculus again associates with each propositional connective a pair of
rules, this time “left” and “right” rules:
\[\hspace{1em}
  \begin{prooftree}
  \def\fCenter{\Lrightarrow}
  \Axiom$\rA, \rB, \Gamma \fCenter \Delta$
  \RightLabel{ $\wedge$(L)}
  \UnaryInf$\rA \wedge \rB, \Gamma\fCenter \Delta$
  \end{prooftree}
\hspace{2em}
  \begin{prooftree}
  \AxiomC{\(\Gamma\Lrightarrow\Theta, \rA\)}
  \AxiomC{\(\Gamma\Lrightarrow\Theta, \rB\)}
  \RightLabel{ $\wedge$(R)}
  \BinaryInfC{\(\Gamma\Lrightarrow\Theta, \rA \wedge \rB\)}
  \end{prooftree}
\]
 
\[\hspace{-3em}
  \begin{prooftree}
  \AxiomC{\(\rA, \Gamma\Lrightarrow\Theta\)}
  \AxiomC{\(\rB, \Gamma\Lrightarrow\Theta\)}
  \RightLabel{ $\vee$(L)}
  \BinaryInfC{\(\rA \vee \rB, \Gamma\Lrightarrow\Theta\)}
  \end{prooftree}
\hspace{2em}
  \begin{prooftree}
  \def\fCenter{\Lrightarrow}
  \Axiom$\Gamma \fCenter \Delta, \rA, \rB$
  \RightLabel{ $\vee$(R)}
  \UnaryInf$\Gamma \fCenter \Delta, \rA \vee \rB$
  \end{prooftree}
\]
 
\[\hspace{-2em}
\begin{prooftree}
  \def\fCenter{\Lrightarrow}
\Axiom$\Gamma\fCenter \Theta, \rA$
\RightLabel{$\neg\text{(L)}$}
\UnaryInf$\neg\rA, \Gamma\fCenter \Theta$
\end{prooftree}
\hspace{6em}
\begin{prooftree}
  \def\fCenter{\Lrightarrow}
\Axiom$\rA, \Gamma\fCenter \Theta$
\RightLabel{$\neg\text{(R)}$}
\UnaryInf$\Gamma\fCenter \Theta, \neg\rA$
\end{prooftree}
\]
 
\[\hspace{-3em}
\begin{prooftree}
  \def\fCenter{\Lrightarrow}
\Axiom$\Gamma\fCenter \Theta, \rA$
\Axiom$\rB, \Gamma\fCenter \Theta$
\RightLabel{${\supset}\text{(L)}$}
\BinaryInf$\rA \supset \rB, \Gamma\fCenter \Theta$
\end{prooftree}
\hspace{2em}
\begin{prooftree}
  \def\fCenter{\Lrightarrow}
\Axiom$\rA, \Gamma\fCenter \Theta, \rB$
\RightLabel{${\supset}\text{(R)}$}
\UnaryInf$\Gamma\fCenter \Theta, \rA \supset \rB$
\end{prooftree}
\]
In the sequent calculi, these left/right rules for the propositional
connectives function alongside another set of rules of structural
reasoning. The classical calculus
pk
has
seven:
\[
\begin{prooftree}
  \def\fCenter{\Lrightarrow}
\Axiom$\Gamma\fCenter \Theta$
\RightLabel{\(\text{thinning(L)}\)}
\UnaryInf$\rD,\Gamma\fCenter \Theta$
\end{prooftree}
\qquad
\begin{prooftree}
  \def\fCenter{\Lrightarrow}
\Axiom$\Gamma\fCenter \Theta$
\RightLabel{\(\text{thinning(R)}\)}
\UnaryInf$\Gamma\fCenter \Theta, \rD$
\end{prooftree}
\]
 
\[
\begin{prooftree}
  \def\fCenter{\Lrightarrow}
\Axiom$\rD, \rD, \Gamma\fCenter \Theta$
\RightLabel{\(\text{contraction(L)}\)}
\UnaryInf$\rD, \Gamma\fCenter \Theta$
\end{prooftree}
\qquad
\begin{prooftree}
  \def\fCenter{\Lrightarrow}
\Axiom$\Gamma\fCenter \Theta, \rD, \rD$
\RightLabel{\(\text{contraction(R)}\)}
\UnaryInf$\Gamma\fCenter \Theta, \rD$
\end{prooftree}
\]
 
\[
\begin{prooftree}
  \def\fCenter{\Lrightarrow}
\Axiom$\Delta, \rD, \rE, \Gamma\fCenter \Theta$
\RightLabel{\(\text{exchange(L)}\)}
\UnaryInf$\Delta, \rE, \rD, \Gamma\fCenter \Theta$
\end{prooftree}
\qquad
\begin{prooftree}
  \def\fCenter{\Lrightarrow}
\Axiom$\Gamma\fCenter \Theta, \rE, \rD, \Delta$
\RightLabel{\(\text{exchange(R)}\)}
\UnaryInf$\Gamma\fCenter \Theta, \rD, \rE, \Delta$
\end{prooftree}
\]
 
\[
\begin{prooftree}
  \def\fCenter{\Lrightarrow}
\Axiom$\Gamma\fCenter \Theta, \rD$
\Axiom$\rD, \Delta\fCenter \Lambda$
\RightLabel{\(\text{cut}\)}
\BinaryInf$\Gamma, \Delta\fCenter \Theta, \Lambda$
\end{prooftree}
\]
A proof in
pk
is a finite branching tree built
from iterations of these logical and structural rules, each leaf node
of which is an basic sequent of the form \(p_i\Lrightarrow p_i\). The
sequent with which the root node is labeled is called the endsequent.
When the endsequent of a
pk
proof has the form
\(\Lrightarrow \rA\), we write \(\turnstile{\PK} \rA\). Gentzen made
several observations about
pk
:
\(\turnstile{\PK} \rA\) if, and only if, \(\turnstile{\CPC} \rA\) if,
and only if, \(\turnstile{\ND+\sfrac{\neg\neg\rA}{\rA}} \rA\)
If one modifies
pk
by requiring the righthand
side of the sequent arrow to have at most one formula and accordingly
rewrites the \(\vee(\rR)\) rule as
\[
\begin{prooftree}
  \def\fCenter{\Lrightarrow}
\Axiom$\Gamma\fCenter \rA$
\RightLabel{\(\vee\text{(R)}\)}
\UnaryInf$\Gamma\fCenter \rB \vee \rA$
\end{prooftree}
\qquad
\begin{prooftree}
  \def\fCenter{\Lrightarrow}
\Axiom$\Gamma\fCenter \rA$
\RightLabel{\(\vee\text{(R)}\)}
\UnaryInf$\Gamma\fCenter \rA \vee \rB$
\end{prooftree}
\]
the resulting calculus
pi
is such that
\(\turnstile{\text{PI}} \rA\) if, and only if, \(\turnstile{\IPC}
\rA\) if, and only if, \(\turnstile{\ND+\sfrac{\bot}{\rA}} \rA\),
where
ipc
stands for Heyting’s formal
deduction system for propositional intuitionistic logic and its
equivalents. (Obviously the rules exchange(R) and contraction(R) play
no role in
pi
and can be omitted.)
Cut Elimination Theorem: If one modifies
pk
and
pi
simply by removing the rule
“cut”, the resulting calculi
pk
-
and
pi
- are such that \(\turnstile{\PK} \rA\)
if, and only if, \(\turnstile{\text{PK-}} \rA\), and
\(\turnstile{\text{PI}} \rA\) if, and only if,
\(\turnstile{\text{PI-}} \rA\).
All the formulas that appear anywhere in a
pk
-
or
pi
- proof are subformulas of the formulas
that appear in the endsequent. (This “subformula property”
clearly does not hold of
pk
and
pi
proofs.)
Observation 2 provides yet another perspective on the way logicians
could disagree about the validity of principles like the law of
excluded middle without disagreeing about the meanings of the
propositional connectives. The treatment of \(\vee\) and \(\neg\) is
identical in
pk
and
pi
;
the only difference between them is in the
background structure of reasoning.
Observation 1 allows one immediately to conclude that
pk
is complete with respect to the classical truth
functional interpretation of propositional logic. Gentzen did not draw
this conclusion because he had a different understanding of
completeness made possible by the sequent calculus: Because the rule
“cut” can be shown to fully capture the general concept of
logical consequence—something Gentzen took himself to have
demonstrated in 1932—, observation 3, that “cut” is
eliminable from
pk
, shows that the left/right
rules for the propositional connectives are complete in the sense that
no logical consequence of formulas provable with them is itself
unprovable with them (see Franks 2010). This way of framing
completeness has the further advantage that
pi
can be said to be complete in the same sense.
2.3.3 Constructive completeness of
pk
and of
pi
Because of observation 4, however, it is possible to prove the
completeness of
pk
in the usual sense very
simply.
Proof.
Let us call a sequent \(\Gamma\Lrightarrow \Delta\)
valid if the formula \(\bigwedge\Gamma\supset\bigvee\Delta\) is valid
on the classical truth-functional interpretation. As one expects, it
is easy to check that all the rules of
pk
preserve validity. More surprisingly, the same rules, except for
thinning, preserve validity when read backwards. Call such inference
figures “invertible”. Suppose now that one is given a
sequent \(\Gamma\Lrightarrow \Delta\) containing
n
logical
connectives. A straightforward mathematical induction demonstrates
that, if \(\Gamma\Lrightarrow \Delta\) is valid, then there is a
pk
-proof
of it. Suppose first that \(n=0
(\Gamma\Lrightarrow \Delta\) contains no logical connectives). Then
there must be some atom \(p_i\) that appears in both its antecedent
and its succedent. Obviously \(\Gamma\Lrightarrow \Delta\) can be
proved from \(p_i \rightarrow p_i\) by a series of thinning and
exchange inferences. Now with the induction hypothesis that
\(\Gamma\Lrightarrow \Delta\) is provable when \(n=k\), suppose
\(n=k+1\). Select any formula in \(\Gamma\Lrightarrow \Delta\) that is
not atomic and identify its main connective. Suppose, for example,
that it is in \(\Gamma\) and its main connective is \(\supset\). Then
we can begin building a proof from the bottom up, using
\(\rA\supset\rB\) as our selected formula and \(\Theta\) to stand for
\(\Gamma\) with the selected occurrence of the formula
\(\rA\supset\rB\) deleted:
\[\begin{prooftree}
 \AxiomC{\(\Theta \Lrightarrow \Delta, \rA\)}
 \AxiomC{\(\rB, \Theta \Lrightarrow \Delta\)}
 \RightLabel{ $\supset$(L)}
 \BinaryInfC{\(\dfrac{\rA \supset \rB, \Theta\Lrightarrow \Delta}
                     {\phantom{\rA \supset \rB,\,}\Gamma\Lrightarrow \Delta}\)}
\end{prooftree}
\kern-5em\lower 1.5em \text{exchange(L)}\]
Because of the invertibility of \(\supset\)
(L)
both leaf
nodes of this tree are labeled with valid sequents containing k
connectives. The induction hypothesis guarantees that they have
pk
-proofs.
Therefore \(\Gamma\Lrightarrow \Delta\)
has a
pk
-proof. An analogous argument applies
for each connective. In the special case that \(\Gamma\) is empty and
\(\Delta\) contains a single (valid) formula, this construction shows
that \(\turnstile{\text{PK-}} \rA\) if
\(\dturnstile{\CTT}
\rA.\) ◻
As was mentioned, Gentzen did not present this very simple version of
the completeness theorem. Because he was interested in cut-elimination
as an expression of the completeness of his rules, he pursued that
instead, providing an elaborate proof transformation technique.
Knowledge of the completeness of
pk
-, though,
leads to an alternate verification of cut-elimination: Suppose
\(\turnstile{\PK} \rA\). Because all basic sequents are valid and all
pk
rules preserve validity,
\(\dturnstile{\CTT} \rA\). But
pk
- is
complete, so \(\turnstile{\PK\text{-}} \rA\) .
Reflection on the construction implicit in this completeness argument
in fact shows that an arbitrary formula can in this way be tested for
validity and therefore provides a new decision procedure for classical
logic: The end result of the construction will either be a proof or
will be a tree whose leaf nodes indicate how to construct a falsifying
interpretation for \(\Gamma\Lrightarrow \Delta.\)
A version of the same argument applies also to
pi
,
not—of course—to show that it is
complete with respect to its classical truth-functional
interpretation, but to show that it is complete with respect to
another sort of interpretation based on Kripke frames. The interesting
thing about this approach to an analysis of intuitionistic logic is
that one need not have in mind in advance what sort of interpretation
one wants to show
pi
complete with respect to.
Just setting out algorithmically to build a cut-free
pi
proof will either succeed or will indicate the
sort of falsifying interpretation that applies in the intuitionistic
case (see Takeuti 1987 [2013]).
3. Non-Classical Interpretations
Classical propositional logic is evidently a valuable framework not
only for organizing principles of reasoning but for providing a fairly
simple setting for showcasing basic theoretical phenomena such as
completeness, formal consistency, axiomatic independence, and the
like. But a considerable measure of the value of its systematic
development lies in the indications, along the way, of ways to deviate
from the classical framework and devise alternative interpretations of
the propositional connectives. We have touched on a few indications
already: the independence of the principle of excluded middle from the
other axioms in Frege’s formal deduction system, the
implausibility of the material conditional as an analysis of the truth
conditions of ordinary indicative mood “if …then”
statements, etc. Here we survey some of the most prevalent alternative
systems of propositional logic.
3.1 Multi-valued logics
Already we indicated how truth-functional interpretations with valence
greater than 2 can be utilized to provide independence proofs for
axiom systems. Gödel (1932) defined a sequence
\(\{S_n\}_{n=2}^\infty\) of
n
-valued logics that generalize the
classical interpretation:
\[\begin{align}
    v(\neg\rA)  &=  \begin{cases}
               0                 & v(\rA) = n-1\\
               n-1               & \text{otherwise}
                  \end{cases}\\
    v(\rA\wedge\rB)  &=  \mathbf{max}\{v(\rA),
v(\rB)\}\\
    v(\rA\vee\rB)  &=  \mathbf{min}\{v(\rA),
v(\rB)\}\\
    v(\rA\supset\rB)  &=  \begin{cases}
               v(\rB)           & v(\rA) <
v(\rB)\\
               0               & \text{otherwise}
           \end{cases}\\
    v(\bot) &= n-1
\end{align}\]
with \(\dturnstile{S_n}\rA\) if \(v(\rA) = 0\) for all assignments of
values from \(\{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}\) to atomic formulas.
\(S_2\) is just the classical theory of truth. \(S_3\) was used above
to demonstrate the independence of Frege’s fifth axiom.
Gödel used the whole sequence in a demonstration that
intuitionistic logic is not complete with respect to any finite-valued
truth-functional interpretation.
Beyond such utilitarian roles, multi-valued logics have attracted
interest in their own right. Important examples are the (strong and
weak) Kleene 3-valued logics, which are meant to assign truth values
to propositions about partial recursive functions. Other 3-valued
logics have been proposed as improvements on the material conditional
as interpretations of indicative mood conditionals (see Cobreros et al
2014). 4-valued logics have been used to model computation on
databases containing conflicting information—here the values
correspond with the information states “true”,
“false”, “both”, and “neither”
(see Belnap 1977). Graham Priest 1992 has applied the same framework
in the development of a system of relevance logic, again offering an
improved formalization of conditional language.
Another important class of multi-valued logics are the
infinitely-valued “fuzzy logics”. These have been used in
order to provide an analysis of propositions with vague terms, which
can be thought of as admitting degrees of truth.
3.2 Constructive logics
We have already noted that simply rejecting the
lem
leads to a subtle deviation from the classical
interpretation: The classical truth functional interpretation falls
away, but the inferential definition of the connectives evident in
natural deduction can be preserved. The intuitionistic propositional
calculus
ipc
has been studied in great depth.
Among its prominent features are:
1. The “disjunction property”: the fact that
\(\turnstile{\IPC} \rA\vee\rB\) only if either \(\turnstile{\IPC}
\rA\) or \(\turnstile{\IPC} \rB\). Gödel (1932, 1933a) contain
the first observations that
ipc
has the
disjunction property. The first recorded proof is in Gentzen
1934–35, where it is a trivial consequence of cut elimination
for
pi
: The only way a
pi
-
proof can have the endsequent \(\Lrightarrow
\rA\vee\rB\) is for the last inference to be a thinning(R) or
\(\vee(\rR)\). If the inference were thinning(R), then the previous
sequent would be \(\Lrightarrow\). Because
pi
is consistent, that is impossible. Therefore, the previous sequent
must either be \(\Lrightarrow \rA\) or \(\Lrightarrow \rB\).
At one time it was conjectured that
ipc
can be
characterized as the strongest propositional logic with the
disjunction property (an example of a weaker logic is
Johansson’s
mpc
, corresponding to the
pure system of natural deduction
nd
). In 1957,
Kreisel and Putnam studied the “independence of premises
(IndPrem)” inference
\[
\begin{prooftree}
\AxiomC{$\neg\rA\supset(\rB\vee\rC)$}\UnaryInfC{($\neg\rA\supset\rB)\vee(\neg\rA\supset\rC)$}
\end{prooftree}
\]
and observed that
\[\neg\rA\supset(\rB\vee\rC)\centernot{\turnstile{\IPC}} (\neg\rA\supset\rB)\vee(\neg\rA\supset\rC)\]
although the logic
kp
=
ipc
+IndPrem
also has the disjunction property. Today
it is known that there are infinitely many distinct logical systems
intermediate in strength between
ipc
and
cpc
,
and that infinitely many of them have the
disjunction property.
2. The failure of truth-functionality: The intuitive understanding of
intuitionism is to replace the idealistic concept of truth with the
notion of having been constructively verified. Some authors suggested
that in the propositional case, this might lead to a 3-valued logic:
one value indicating that a statement was constructively verified,
another value indicating that it had been constructively refuted, and
a third value indicating that neither of these is the case. This seems
at least to accord with
ipc
’s rejection
of
lem
. However, because there are only a
small number of 3-valued semantic environments, others were able to
rule out this possibility case-by case. This led to speculation that
the right semantics might have valence 4 or possibly 5.
Gödel’s 1932 proof rules out all truth-functional
interpretations of any finite valence.
Because of the failure of truth-functionality, a new framework for
understanding
ipc
validity is needed. Adequate
topological, algebraic, and Kripke-frame semantics have been
introduced, and completeness results demonstrating a correspondence
between these frameworks and various proof systems abound. We have
already indicated that the completeness argument for the
intuitionistic sequent calculus
pi
with
respect to Kripke frames is a variation of the simple constructive
completeness theorem for
pk
with respect to
the classical theory of truth. Again, the argument shows that
pi
is decidable: Given a formula A, the algorithm
either returns a
pi
-proof of A or a falsifying
Kripke frame.
There is also an informal, intuitive understanding of
ipc
theoremhood called the BHK interpretation.
According to this interpretation, the disjunction property is a formal
analogue of the definition of the \(\vee\) symbol: To have a proof of
\(\rA\vee\rB\) just means that either \(\rA\) or \(\rB\) has been
proved. In a similar fashion, to have a proof of \(\rA\wedge\rB\)
means that both \(\rA\) and \(\rB\) have been proved; a proof of
\(\rA\supset\rB\) is a construction that allows any proof of A to be
transformed into a proof of B; a proof of \(\neg\rA\) is a
construction that allows any proof of A to be transformed into a proof
of \(\bot\). In this specification of the meanings of the connectives,
“provability” refers to informal provability by any means
whatsoever, rather than to formal provability within a specific
system.
Because the BHK interpretation specifies, not what expressions like
\(\rA\vee\rB\) and \(\rA\supset\rB\) mean, but what it means to say
that such expressions are provable, the \(\supset\) connective is
typically referred to in the intuitionistic setting as the
“implication” operator. This is sometimes misread as a
disagreement with the classical distinction between the conditional
connective and the implication relation. But as we have seen, on the
classical conception, too, the expression \(\vdash \rA\supset\rB\)
represents implication, i.e., truth of the conditional claim on every
assignment. On the intuitionistic conception, however, the connectives
are understood primitively in terms of what it means for expressions
governed by them to be provable. The same conception figures into the
understanding of connectives in relevance logic, where again
\(\supset\) is typically described as an implication operator (and its
classical treatment is faulted for engendering the “paradoxes of
material implication”, not the “paradoxes of material
conditionalization”.)
3. A striking feature of
ipc
is the presence
of inference rules like IndPrem that are not derivable
\[\neg\rA\supset(\rB\vee\rC) \centernot{\turnstile{\IPC}} (\neg\rA\supset\rB)\vee(\neg\rA\supset\rC)\]
but that nevertheless preserve the property of
ipc
-provability.
Other examples of such rules
are
\[ \begin{prooftree}
 \AxiomC{$(\rA\supset\rB)\supset (\rA\vee\rC)$}
 \RightLabel{ Mints’s rule}
 \UnaryInfC{(($\rA\supset\rB)\supset\rA)\vee((\rA\supset\rB)\supset\rC)$}
\end{prooftree}\]
 
\[\begin{prooftree}
  \AxiomC{$(\neg\neg\rA\supset\rA)\supset (\neg\neg\rA\vee\neg\rA)$}
  \RightLabel{ Rose’s rule}
  \UnaryInfC{$\neg\neg\rA\vee\neg\rA$}
\end{prooftree}\]
Is it right to say that such rules are valid patterns of
intuitionistic inference? The question is ambiguous in a way that
experience with classical logic desensitizes one to. For it can be
shown that any rule that preserves the property of being a classical
validity is also derivable in
cpc
itself. The
fact that the rules under whose application the set of
ipc
theorems is closed properly extends the
ipc
-derivable
rules leads to a new concept: the
former rules are called “admissible”. The intuitionsitic
study of propositional logic thereby reveals a fundamental distinction
in the basic concept of deductive validity, between a rule licensing
legitimate inferences from theorems and it applying also to arbitrary
hypotheses.
Because the primitive understanding of logical connectives from the
intuitionist perspective is in terms of the conditions of the
provability of statements containing them, one might, and many authors
have, maintained that admissibility is the proper precisification of
the concept of deductive validity for
ipc
. On
the other hand, what distinguishes
ipc
from
mpc
is the derivability of the rule
ex
falso quodlibet
. That rule (as well as the disjunctive syllogism)
is admissible already in
mpc
, so the decision
to include it explicitly as a derivable inference in
ipc
indicates some recognition of the importance of
derivability. What can be said definitely is that the distinction
between derivability and admissibility is important in constructive
logics in a way that it is not in
cpc
.
4. Three of the De Morgan inferences are derivable in
ipc
,
but the inference
\(\frac{\neg(\rA\wedge\rB)}{\neg\rA\vee\neg\rB}\) is not.
ipc
therefore serves as a background theory from
which the strength of this inference can be measured. One might
conjecture that
ipc
+\(\frac{\neg(\rA\wedge\rB)}{\neg\rA\vee\neg\rB}\)
is fully classical, but in fact this system still does not prove
lem
.
It does, however, prove the so-called weak law
of excluded middle (
wlem
):
\(\neg\rA\vee\neg\neg\rA\). Moreover, all De Morgan’s inferences
are derivable in
ipc
+
wlem
,
so that
wlem
and
\(\frac{\neg(\rA\wedge\rB)}{\neg\rA\vee\neg\rB}\) can be said to be
equivalent over the base theory
ipc
. The logic
ipc
+\(\frac{\neg(\rA\wedge\rB)}{\neg\rA\vee\neg\rB}\),
sometimes called De Morgan logic or Jankov’s logic, occupies a
unique place in the hierarchy of systems intermediate in strength
between
ipc
and
cpc
.
It has a natural realization in the Medvedev lattice of degrees of
solvability. The setting is Baire space \(\omega^\omega\) (the set of
functions from \(\omega\) to \(\omega\)) and the problem of producing
an element of a given subset of this space. Subsets of Baire space are
called mass problems, and their elements are called solutions. One
mass problem is said to reduce to another if there is an effective
procedure for transforming solutions of the second into solutions of
the first. If one defines the lattice \(\calM\) of degrees of
reducibility of mass problems, the set of identities of \(\calM\)
corresponds to the set of theorems De Morgan logic (Sorbi 1991), so
that the theory of mass problems provides a constructive
interpretation of this logic. (This is like a constructive analogue to
the way switching circuits are a realization of
cpc
.)
Unlike
ipc
, however,
no rule admissible in De Morgan logic is underivable (Prucnal 1976).
Thus one sees that
wlem
, standing in the place
of full
lem
, allows for a constructive
interpretation without exhibiting underivable admissible rules.
5. We have observed how the Gentzen calculi highlight certain
relationships between
ipc
and
cpc
.
Translation schemes of Kolmogorov, Glivenko,
Gödel, and Gentzen make evident other relationships between these
and other systems. We begin with a result of Valérii Glivenko
(1929):
Theorem 6
.
If \(\turnstile{\CPC}\rA\), then
\(\turnstile{\IPC}\neg\neg\rA\).
Proof.
First observe three simple facts about
nd
+\(\frac{\bot}{\rA}\),
the natural deduction
equivalent of
ipc
:
\[\tag*{V1}
\turnstile{\ND+\sfrac{\bot}{\rA}}\neg\neg(\rB\vee\neg\rB) 
\]
\[\tag*{V2}
\neg\neg\rB\turnstile{\ND+\sfrac{\bot}{\rA}+ (\rC\vee\neg\rC)}\rB 
\]
\[\tag*{V3}
\neg\neg\neg\rB\turnstile{\ND+\sfrac{\bot}{\rA}}\neg\rB 
\]
For the proof of the main theorem, suppose \(\turnstile{\CPC}\rA\).
Then by
V2
we have \(\turnstile{\ND+\sfrac{\bot}{\rA}+ (\rC\vee\neg\rC)}\rA\),
hence a proof in
nd
+\(\frac{\bot}{\rA}\)+\((\rC\vee\neg\rC)\):
\[
\begin{prooftree}
  \AxiomC{$\text{P}_{1}\vee\neg\text{P}_{1}$}
  \noLine
  \UnaryInfC{$\ddots$}
  \AxiomC{$\text{P}_{2}\vee\neg\text{P}_{2}$}
  \noLine
  \UnaryInfC{$\ddots$}
  \AxiomC{$\cdots$}
  \noLine
  \UnaryInfC{\(\iddots\)}
  \AxiomC{$\text{P}_{k}\vee\neg\text{P}_{k}$}
  \noLine
  \UnaryInfC{\(\iddots\)}
  \noLine
  \QuaternaryInfC{$\rA$}
\end{prooftree}  
\]
By
V1
,
 there exist
nd
+\(\frac{\bot}{\rA}\)proofs:
\[
\begin{prooftree}
  \AxiomC{$\ddots$}
  \AxiomC{$\iddots$}
  \noLine
  \BinaryInfC{$\neg\neg (\text{P}_{1}\vee\text{P}_{1}$)}
\end{prooftree}
\qquad
\begin{prooftree}
  \AxiomC{$\ddots$}
  \AxiomC{$\iddots$}
  \noLine
  \BinaryInfC{$\neg\neg (\text{P}_{2}\vee\text{P}_{2}$)}
\end{prooftree}
  \ldots
\begin{prooftree}
  \AxiomC{$\ddots$}
  \AxiomC{$\iddots$}
  \noLine
  \BinaryInfC{$\neg\neg (\text{P}_{k}\vee\text{P}_{k}$)}
\end{prooftree}
\]
From these pieces one can construct a
nd
+\(\frac{\bot}{\rA}\)proof:
That completes the proof of the main theorem. ◻
We observe two corollaries:
V4
If \(\turnstile{\CPC}\neg\rA\), then \(\turnstile{\IPC}\neg\rA\).
This follows immediately from the main theorem and
V3
.
V5
cpc
is inconsistent only if
ipc
is.
For if
cpc
is inconsistent, then there is a
formula \(\rA\) such that \(\turnstile{\CPC}\rA\) and
\(\turnstile{\CPC}\neg\rA\). But then \(\turnstile{\IPC}\neg\neg\rA\)
and \(\turnstile{\IPC}\neg\rA\).
Glivenko’s theorem provides a simple translation \(t_\rV\) of
classical logic into intuitionistic logic defined by \(t_\rV (\rA) =
\neg\neg\rA\) for all formulas A. It is a translation in the sense
that \(\turnstile{\CPC}\rA\) if, and only if,
\(\turnstile{\IPC}t_\rV(\rA\)). This translation is limited in that it
does not extend to quantification theory. Kolmogorov (1925) provided a
variation \(t_\rK\) as follows:
\(t_\rK(p)\) is \(\neg\neg p\), for all propositional
variables
\(t_\rK(\neg\rA)\) is \(\neg t_\rK(\rA)\)
\(t_\rK(\rB\wedge\rC)\) is \(\neg\neg(t_\rK(\rB)\wedge
t_\rK(\rC))\)
\(t_\rK (\rB\vee\rC)\) is \(\neg\neg (t_\rK(\rB)\vee\
t_\rK(\rC))\)
\(t_\rK(\rB\supset\rC)\) is \(\neg\neg (t_\rK(\rB)\supset
t_\rK(\rC)\)
The Gödel/Gentzen (1933) translation \(t_\rG\) is defined by:
\(t_\rG(p)\) is \(\neg\neg p\), for all propositional
variables
\(t_\rG(\neg\rA)\) is \(\neg t_\rG(\rA)\)
\(t_\rG(\rB\wedge\rC)\) is \(t_\rG(\rB)\wedge t_\rG(\rC)\)
\(t_\rG (\rB\vee\rC)\) is \(\neg (\neg t_\rG(\rB)\wedge\neg
t_\rG(\rC))\)
\(t_\rG(\rB\supset\rC)\) is \(t_\rG(\rB)\supset t_\rG(\rC)\)
It is easy to show that \(\turnstile{\CPC}\rA\) if, and only if,
\(\turnstile{\IPC}t_\rK(\rA\)) if, and only if,
\(\turnstile{\IPC}t_\rG(\rA\)). Unlike \(t_\rV\), the schemes of
Kolmogorov and of Gödel/Gentzen can be extended to quantifiers.
The latter can be further extended to theories of arithmetic and to
set theory (see Troelstra & van Dalen 1988).
In 1933b, Gödel provided similar translation from
ipc
to the modal logic
S4
.
S4
is
cpc
supplemented with a new primitive symbol
\(\Box\) so that, if A is a formula, then \(\Box\rA\) is a formula, a
new rule of inference
\(\dfrac{\rA}{\Box\rA}\)
and three new axioms
\(\Box\rA\supset\rA\)
\(\Box\rA\supset (\Box (\rA\supset\rB)\supset\Box\rB)\)
\(\Box\rA\supset\Box\Box\rA\)
Gödel defined a translation \(t_\Box\) of formulas from
ipc
into the language of
S4
by:
\(t_\Box(\neg\rA) \text{ is } \Box\neg\Box t_\Box(\rA)\)
\(t_\Box(\rA\supset\rB) \text{ is } \Box t_\Box(\rA)\supset\Box
t_\Box(\rB)\)
\(t_\Box(\rA\vee\rB) \text{ is } \Box t_\Box(\rA)\vee\Box
t_\Box(\rB)\)
\(t_\Box(\rA\wedge\rB) \text{ is } \Box t_\Box(\rA)\wedge\Box
t_\Box(\rB)\)
and stated, without proof:
\[\turnstile{\IPC}\rA \text{ if, and only if, }
\turnstile{\text{S4}} t_\Box(\rA).\tag{*}\]
Gödel further declared both that “the translation of
\(\rA\vee\neg\rA\) is not derivable in
S4
”
and also that “neither in
general is any formula of the form \(\Box\rA\vee\Box\rB\) for which
neither \(\Box\rA\) nor \(\Box\rB\) is already provable in
S4
”:
\[\turnstile{\text{S4}}\Box\rA\vee\Box\rB
\text{ only if either }\turnstile{\text{S4}}\Box\rA
\text{ or }
\turnstile{\text{S4}}\Box\rB\tag{**}\]
(*) and (**) together obviously entail the disjunction property for
ipc
.
3.3 Relevance and connexive logics
Returning to the problem of approximating natural language
expressions, some writers have proposed overcoming the apparent
inadequacies of the material conditional by stipulating stronger
conditions on the truth of propositions of the form \(\rA\supset\rB\).
Relevance logicians suggest that many of the features exhibited by the
material conditional that seem like departures from speakers’
intuitions about the truth of conditional expressions stem from
ascriptions of truth to conditionals whose antecedents are irrelevant
to their consequents. As a formal measure to ensure relevance, they
propose a “variable sharing condition”. Variable sharing
is generally thought to be only a necessary condition for relevance,
however, and the project of describing sufficient formal conditions is
ongoing.
Connexive logicians aim instead to make good of the intuition that for
a conditional statement to be true, the negation of its consequent
should be incompatible with its antecedent. This requirement on the
truth of conditional statements has a formidable history, appearing in
logical manuscripts of the Stoic philosophers Chrysippus and Sextus
Empiricus and evidently garnering more support at the time than the
contrary opinion of Philo of Melaga. A related idea appears already in
the
Prior Analytics
, where Aristotle claimed that it is
impossible that if not A, then A. This, “Aristotle’s
thesis”, can be formalized as \(\neg (\neg\rA\supset\rA)\),
which is obviously invalid both classically and intuitionistically.
Sometimes instead the formula \(\neg (\rA\supset\neg\rA)\) is called
Aristotle’s thesis. Systems of connexive logic accept both as
axioms, as well as the principles
\((\rA\supset\rB)\supset\neg(\rA\supset\neg\rB)\) and
\((\rA\supset\neg\rB)\supset\neg(\rA\supset\rB)\), which purport to
formalize the original idea attributed to Chrysippus above. (These
latter two principles are interderivable, over the base theory
ipc
,
with Aristotle’s theses).
By including as theorems principles that are classically invalid, such
logics risk trivialization because of the maximality of
cpc
.
Some approaches address this problem by
rejecting classical principles such as the \(\wedge\)-elimination rule
of natural deduction, avoiding thereby any formula and its negation
being theorems. Other approaches are “paraconsistent”,
i.e., they allow theorems A and \(\neg\rA\) but do not allow the
derivation of arbitrary formulas from this contradiction.
Paraconsistent approaches are often interpretable with the 4-valued
truth-assignment mentioned above.
3.4 Linear logic
If many departures from the classical framework are motivated by
wanting to study connectives that more closely approximate the truth
conditions of ordinary language expressions, linear logic (introduced
in Girard 1987) can be thought of as a push in the opposite direction.
Just as Frege saw logical significance in the material conditional
despite (maybe even because of) its lack of correspondence with
ordinary “if …then” statements for reasons internal
to logical theory, linear logic can be thought of as an attempt to
discover in the fine structure of formal logic those propositional
connectives that play specific inference-tracking roles that ordinary
expressions might be too crude to articulate.
We saw earlier how in the sequent calculus classical and
intuitionistic logic differ not in the inference rules governing the
propositional connectives but in the background structure of
reasoning—specifically, in the presence or absence of multiple
formulas in succedents. Linear logic analyzes this relationship
further through adjustments to other structural aspects of reasoning.
It is well known that the operational rules of
pk
can be written either in a
“context-sharing” or “context-independent”
form. The operational rules were given a context-sharing presentation
above, but for example the rule
\[
\begin{prooftree}
  \def\fCenter{\Lrightarrow}
\Axiom$\Gamma\fCenter \Theta, \rA$
\Axiom$\rB, \Gamma\fCenter \Theta$
\RightLabel{\({{\supset}\text{(L)-cs}}\)}
\BinaryInf$\rA \supset \rB, \Gamma\fCenter \Theta$
\end{prooftree}
\]
could instead be given a context-independent presentation:
\[
\begin{prooftree}
  \def\fCenter{\Lrightarrow}
\Axiom$\Gamma\fCenter \Theta, \rA$
\Axiom$\rB, \Delta\fCenter \Lambda$
\RightLabel{\({\supset}\text{(L)-ci}\)}
\BinaryInf$\rA \supset \rB, \Gamma, \Delta\fCenter \Lambda, \Theta$
\end{prooftree}
\]
The equivalence of these presentations is easy to verify:
\[
\xlongequal[{\Large \rA \,\supset\, \rB, \Gamma \,\Lrightarrow\, \Theta}]
{\Large
    \begin{prooftree}
    \def\fCenter{\Lrightarrow}
    \Axiom$\Gamma\fCenter \Theta, \rA$
    \Axiom$\rB, \Gamma\fCenter \Theta$
    \BinaryInf$\rA \,\supset\, \rB, \Gamma, \Gamma \fCenter \Theta, \Theta$
    \end{prooftree} }
\raise 1.6em {{\supset}\text{(L)-ci}}
\kern -3.5em \text{\}exchanges and contractions}
\]
 
\[\frac{
  \xlongequal[{\Large \Gamma,\Delta \,\Lrightarrow\, \Lambda,\Theta,\rA}]{{\Large \Gamma \,\Lrightarrow\, \Theta,\rA}} 
\text{\}thinnings and exchanges\{}
  \xlongequal[{\Large\rB,\Gamma, \Delta \,\Lrightarrow\, \Lambda,\Theta}]{{\Large \rB, \Delta \,\Lrightarrow\, \Lambda}} 
}{
 \rA \supset \rB, \Gamma, \Delta \,\Lrightarrow\, \Lambda, \Theta
}
{\supset}\text{(L)-cs}
\]
but we see that their equivalence depends on the presence of the
structural rules thinning and contraction.
In propositional linear logic, there are two conjunction-like
operators, \(\otimes\) and \(\amp\), and two disjunction-like
operators \(\oplus\) and \(\parr\). \(\oplus\) is given a
context-sharing left rule and a right rule with “built-in
thinning” like the intuitionistic version of \(\vee(\rR)\).
\(\parr\) is its structural dual: its left rule is context-independent
and its right rule is just like the classical \(\vee(\rR)\).
Similarly, \(\otimes(\rR)\) is context-independent and \(\otimes\)(L)
is just like the classical \(\wedge\)(L), whereas \(\&(\rR)\) is
context-sharing and \(\&\)(L) has built in thinning. The
connectives \(\&\) and \(\oplus\) with context-sharing rules are
called “additives”; \(\otimes\) and \(\parr\) with
context-independent rules are called “multiplicatives”.
But there are no structural rules for thinning and contraction, so the
additive and multiplicative rules are not equivalent.
Disambiguating the logical conjunction and disjunction into additive
and multiplicative versions lends great perspicuity to the
relationship between classical and intuitionistic logic. For example,
there are two versions of
lem
. The additive
version \(\rA\oplus\neg\rA\) can be thought of as based on the
intuitionsitic disjunction: Since neither of its disjuncts is
provable, neither is it. The multiplicative version
\(\rA\parr\neg\rA\), on the other hand, corresponds to the classical
understanding and is readily provable (“linear
implication” \(\rA\multimap\rB\) is defined as
\(\neg\rA\parr\rB\), so the multiplicative
lem
corresponds with the linear identity \(\rA\multimap\rA\)).
In the absence of contraction and weakening, formulas of linear logic
stand for something more like resources than permanent statements or
constructions. Just as intuitionistic logic replaced the classical
understanding of a conditional \(\rA\supset\rB\) “either A is
false or B is true” with a procedural claim “Given A, I
can produce B”, linear logic is able to distinguish claims
“Given one copy of A, I can produce one copy of B” from
“Given three copies of A, I can produce one copy of B”.
This allows modeling of propositions about resource use in
computation, and much of the attention directed towards linear logic
has arisen because of its natural realization in computational models
such as Petri nets.
The fragment of linear logic presented so far is called
mall
(for multiplicative/additive linear logic). In
order to preserve its distinctive properties but also be able to
express claims interpretable as, for example, the intuitionistic
implication, the linear modalities are introduced. These are unary
connectives for which restricted forms of weakening and contraction
apply. They are called “modalities” for a reason, though:
They are governed by the same left and right rules as the necessity
and possibility operators of modal logic
S4
.
This makes it unclear whether full linear
logic
ll
with their inclusion qualifies as a
propositional logic.
This is no fault of linear logic, but rather one of its main
contributions to the study of propositions. As stressed in the
introduction to this article, a helpful attitude for the development
of propositional logic is to bracket questions about the nature of
propositions and simply require that the propositional connectives
return expressions of the same order as those they operate on. From
this perspective, the idea of “persistent factual truth”
or “reusable construction”, which is the basic starting
point of classical and intuitionistic logic, is related to linear
logic’s basic unit of “limited resource” just as the
modalities “necessary truth” and “possible
truth” are related to the category of “persistent factual
truth” or “reusable construction”.

More Readings
Most textbooks treat propositional logic as an elementary step
en
route
to quantification theory or another more general topic. A
notable exception is:
Schechter, Eric, 2005,
Classical and Nonclassical Logics: An
Introduction to the Mathematics of Propositions
, N.J: Princeton
University Press.
Another sensitive treatment of propositional logic with attention to
non-classical interpretations is:
Gamut, L. T. F., 1990,
Logic, Language, and Meaning, Volume 1:
Introduction to Logic
, Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press.
Translation of
Logica, taal en betekenis I: inleiding in de
logica
, Utrecht: Het Spectrum, 1982. (L. T. F. Gamut is a
collective name for Johan van Benthem, J. A. G. Groenendijk, D. H. J.
de Jongh, M. J. B. Stokhof, and H. J. Verkuyl.)
Among standard textbook treatments, standout presentations of
propositional logic can be found in Quine 1982 and in:
Buss, Samuel R., 1998, “An Introduction to Proof
Theory”, in
Handbook of Proof Theory
, Samuel R. Buss
(ed.), (Studies in Logic and the Foundations of Mathematics 137),

subject in the early twentieth century is:
